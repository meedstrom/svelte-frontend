<p>
[&#x2026;] This is not the same question as “How do I argue Occam’s Razor to a
hypothetical debater who has not already accepted it?”
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you cannot argue anything to a hypothetical debater who has not accepted Occam’s Razor, just as you cannot argue anything to a rock. A mind needs a certain amount of dynamic structure to be an argument-acceptor. If a mind doesn’t implement Modus Ponens, it can accept “A” and “A-&gt;B” all day long without ever producing “B”. How do you justify Modus Ponens to a mind that hasn’t accepted it?  How do you argue a rock into becoming a mind?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Our minds implement Modus Ponens, Occamian priors and other fundamentals, and they make sense to us because we are built with them.  We believe the validity of modus ponens because we fundamentally work by modus ponens!
</p>

<p>
So at some point when you reach up against questioning modus ponens, you end up in a sort of reflective loop.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
And what about trusting reflective coherence in general? Wouldn’t most possible minds, randomly generated and allowed to settle into a state of reflective coherence, be incorrect? Ah, but we evolved by natural selection; we were not generated randomly.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
So, at the end of the day, what happens when someone keeps asking me “Why do you believe what you believe?”
</p>

<p>
At present, I start going around in a loop at the point where I explain, “I predict the future as though it will resemble the past on the simplest and most stable level of organization I can identify, because previously, this rule has usually worked to generate good results; and using the simple assumption of a simple universe, I can see why it generates good results; and I can even see how my brain might have evolved to be able to observe the universe with some degree of accuracy, if my observations are correct.”
</p>

<p>
But then… haven’t I just licensed circular logic?
</p>

<p>
Actually, I’ve just licensed reflecting on your mind’s degree of trustworthiness, using your current mind as opposed to something else.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A reflective loop of this sort is a bit different from the circular logic of "my blind faith was placed in me by God, and is therefore trustworthy" &#x2013; for one thing, the latter doubles as a stopsign.  You <i>can</i> unpack the sentence and its origins if you want to, but you decide there's nothing more to do and stop there, whereas with the reflective loop it's not just you.  Every philosopher (with a modus-ponens-designed brain) agrees there's nothing more to do from within the mind of the reflecter.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In point of fact, when religious people finally come to reject the Bible, they do not do so by magically jumping to a non-religious state of pure emptiness, and then evaluating their religious beliefs in that non-religious state of mind, and then jumping back to a new state with their religious beliefs removed.
</p>

<p>
People go from being religious, to being non-religious, because even in a religious state of mind, doubt seeps in.  They notice [examples] and it doesn’t seem to make sense even under their own religious premises.
</p>

<p>
Being religious doesn’t make you less than human. Your brain still has the abilities of a human brain. The dangerous part is that being religious might stop you from applying those native abilities to your religion—stop you from reflecting fully on yourself. People don’t heal their errors by resetting themselves to an ideal philosopher of pure emptiness and reconsidering all their sensory experiences from scratch. They heal themselves by becoming more willing to question their current beliefs, using more of the power of their current mind.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Basically questioning Occam's Razor is asking you to step outside your own mind, which is asking the impossible.  Even a superintelligence can't do that.
</p>
<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>
There are possible minds in mind design space who have anti-Occamian and anti-Laplacian priors; they believe that simpler theories are less likely to be correct, and that the more often something happens, the less likely it is to happen again.
</p>

<p>
And when you ask these strange beings why they keep using priors that never seem to work in real life… they reply, “Because it’s never worked for us before!”
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
When I examine the causal history of my brain—its origins in natural selection—I find, on the one hand, all sorts of specific reasons for doubt; my brain was optimized to run on the ancestral savanna, not to do math. But on the other hand, it’s also clear why, loosely speaking, it’s possible that the brain really could work. Natural selection would have quickly eliminated brains so completely unsuited to reasoning, so anti-helpful, as anti-Occamian or anti-Laplacian priors.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
So what I did in practice, does not amount to declaring a sudden halt to questioning and justification. I’m not halting the chain of examination at the point that I encounter Occam’s Razor, or my brain, or some other unquestionable. The chain of examination continues—but it continues, unavoidably, using my current brain and my current grasp on reasoning techniques. What else could I possibly use?
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]  Still… wouldn’t it be nice if we could examine the problem of how much to trust our brains <i>without</i> using our current intelligence? Wouldn’t it be nice if we could examine the problem of how to think, <i>Without</i> using our current grasp of rationality?
</p>

<p>
When you phrase it <i>that</i> way, it starts looking like the answer might be “No”.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I don't entirely buy it.  If those alien minds with anti-Occamian priors were to go ahead and doubt their own priors the same way some philosophers argue we can doubt Occam's Razor, perhaps that gives them a chance to "escape" their poor mind-design.  Is it not possible to find some principled approach, some way to explore fuzzing our own priors and finding out what's actually best?  Their counterpart to Eliezer might argue, as does ours, that doing so would abandon what they know as good reasoning, which is the last thing you want to do when debugging your own reasoning.  Only, their Eliezer would actually be wrong (by our judgment) &#x2013; it'd actually be good for them to abandon their priors (by our judgment).
</p>

<p>
As per that parable of the deluded patient who believes he's a psychiatrist and that his psychiatrist is his patient, but agrees to take a drug that cures the delusion together with the psychiatrist, and then whichever one was deluded, "the patient makes a full recovery" &#x2013; should we not try, too?
</p>

<p>
I admit I cannot imagine the particulars.

<title>Task constipation</title>

<p>
What is task constipation?
</p>

<p>
Example.  I promise a friend to post an ad on Tradera by lunchtime.  Then I spend a few hours on other things.  The promised task applies pressure in the back of my head that I'm studiously ignoring.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, if my friend texts me, I can't respond or even read the text because I would prefer to have done that task I promised first.  So I'm unresponsive and emotionally unavailable.
</p>

<p>
Then I finally do the task.  Freshly clear of "task constipation", I'm free to flood my friend with responses, though they may be much too late to be appreciated.

<ul>
<li>if you decide you don't want to delay responding to people, because it's nice not to delay, then remembering that may make it easier to summon a bit of steel in the stomach and admit "nope, didn't do that yet" even though you're not proud
<ul>
<li>some minimum of self-esteem required</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if you avoid saying what you plan on doing in the first place, this effect won't show up so much</li>
<li>if it's already very late, you can always think whether or not you want to continue being quiet or talk to this friend. that could drive you to do some of the task.</li>

<li>Or if not an iOS shortcut, could I just transmit calendar events thru Beorg?  I suspect that if it's not to feel stilted &#x2013; if I'm to get over that hump and start calendaring more and more things thru Org, so that Beorg feels more and more like a natural extension of me &#x2013; then I should sync my entire roam folder onto my phone.  I'm a bit uncomfortable with that.  But that would be the natural way: so that I can spawn a subheading in literally any of my files, titled "Review this", and not think about finding the specific file.
<ul>
<li>But it's true that todo lists don't really work for me and this will not change that.  So I would only use it for reminders that don't attach much of a todo, or timeful reminders.  I suppose instead of a todo.org I could have a reminders.org.</li>

<ul>
<li>You must place the theme selector buttons at the top of the page&#x2014;above everything else.
<ul>
<li>You can also place them at the bottom by exploiting <code>flex-direction: column-reverse</code>.  However, you do that and the theme buttons will be stacked vertically.  Until Firefox implements the CSS pseudo-class <code>:has()</code>, you don't get to put them inside a footer div to change the flex-layout.
<ul>
<li>Once Firefox does, it'll also be possible to put them in a sidebar. Mind that the sidebar could not itself be themed, so it's not as great as it seems</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You will still need Javascript to persist the theme choice across different pages.  So unless it's a single-page app, not worth bothering.</li>

<h2 id="org5f0146d"><a href="#org5f0146d">Background</a></h2>

<p>
What is it that every Org-mode knowledge worker needs but doesn't have?  A WYSIWYG Org editor for mobile.
</p>

<p>
You see, for the use-case of plain notetaking, all the traditional Org apps like Beorg, PlainOrg, MobileOrg and Organice fall flat: they seem to be oriented towards TODO tasks &amp; scheduling &amp; reminders, and they presume that if you write prose or poetry, you will only capture to an inbox file and sort it out later on your desktop.  Polish a hundred files of prose?  No way, no one does that!  Right?  (None of your users do, I'm sure, but there's a reason for that)
</p>

<p>
So, they hide the free-form text editor several screen taps away, and it lacks all UX.
</p>

<p>
I'm not looking for TODO task integration, I just need a smooth writing experience like the iPhone's built-in Notes app.  Nothing more.  Because I have to use apps like iOS Notes instead of Beorg &amp; co, all my notes on-the-go end up siloed in that app.  I'm tired of mentally tracking the disconnect between "my notes on the phone" and "my real Org notes on the laptop".
</p>

<p>
Enter Logseq!  If you've briefly tried Logseq mobile in the past, you might be surprised to hear that <b>it has a reasonable editing experience,</b> more so than the other platforms I mentioned.
</p>

<p>
However, Logseq appears confusing on first try.  It uses non-standard UX and lacks some discoverability, and the tutorials I found by Googling failed to cut through to the relevant facts for someone like you and me.
</p>

<h2 id="org84bcdee"><a href="#org84bcdee">The gotchas I wish someone'd told me</a></h2>

<p>
Disclaimer: not all these problems will apply to you.  I would have fewer problems writing "traditional" large Org files, but I write according to org-roam conventions, i.e. many small "zettelkasten".
</p>

<p>
OK, let's get started!
</p>

<section class="odd">
<h3 id="org1ae6165"><a href="#org1ae6165">Formatting norms</a></h3>

<p>
Starting out, you'll note Logseq seems to put absolutely everything in a list.  <b>These lists are a lie</b>.  What you think is a list item is what they call a "block", which translates to Org jargon as a <b>subtree</b>.
</p>

<p>
This looks familiar only so long as you don't really have paragraph-text under your Org headings.  If you do, you can hide the leading bullets by switching to "Document mode", and the result may feel more familiar.
</p>

<p>
To make sense of the Logseq UI, know that it's designed around the assumption you'll use subtrees extensively.  This flies in the face of how I and many others write in Org-roam: many of my files have zero subtrees.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
The above leads us to a small gotcha: Logseq expects headings.  If the first logical line of text is not a heading, <b>Logseq will still interpret it as a heading.</b>  So there's this odd leading bullet out of nowhere before the first paragraph.  Think nothing of it; it's only cosmetic.  Again, Document mode should hide it (sometimes it bugs and does not, so turn it off and back on).
</p>

<p>
(In fact, the bullet-out-of-nowhere happens even if the first paragraph is actually a set of properties such as <code>#+TITLE</code>, but you can hide them by putting into <code>config.edn</code> the line <code>:block-hidden-properties #{:title}</code>.  Then you'll instead have an empty line at the top, which is there because of the file-level ID in your Org-roam files.  Again, just cosmetic.  A blank line isn't so bad.)
</p>
<hr />

<p>
On the mobile app, we have buttons for manipulating subtrees: all the polished stuff you'd expect, like indenting and outdenting them, and moving them.  <b>These work only on subtrees!</b>  In fact, TODO state ends up being visually rendered <i>as a checkbox</i> when you're not editing, which tells you something about how they intend subtrees to be used.
</p>

<p>
You don't need to adopt the writing style presumed by Logseq, but it basically works like this: imagine that your initfiles include <code>(setq org-startup-folded 'showeverything)</code>, and you eliminate the settings for the faces <code>org-level-1</code> thru <code>org-level-8</code> so that headings look just like the <code>default</code> face.  Then you write lots and lots of headings, as if they were plain lists, and forget about regular plain lists.  That's the expected style in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind, Logseq will render conventional Org documents fairly sanely, so it works fine <b>as a viewer</b>.  The discomfort arises when you want to edit inside Logseq and still stick to your non-Logseq norms: then you need to always keep in mind what you're doing to the underlying file.  But I expect this becomes second nature after some time.
</p>

<section class="even">
<h4 id="org69a1aea"><a href="#org69a1aea">Collaboration</a></h4>

<p>
An extra conundrum arises when you want to use Logseq <b>to collaborate on documents with a partner</b>.  In that case, I suggest giving up and formatting those specific documents in the Logseq way to make your partners more comfortable in the app, if they aren't technical people.
</p>

<p>
To edit such Logseq-ified documents in Emacs, I make myself comfortable with this buffer-local mode:

<p>
Also: Never write tables or plain lists in these documents, they're hard to edit from inside Logseq mobile.
</p>

<p>
For the rest of this post, my tips assume you <b>aren't</b> doing this, but formatting org-mode files like you'd normally do: with headings-as-headings (as short as possible), NOT headings-as-paragraphs (potentially very long).
</p>

<section class="odd">
<h5 id="org5df0092"><a href="#org5df0092">Syncing</a></h5>

<p>
If any of your devices is an iPhone/iPad, you'll have to use Logseq Sync, an experimental beta feature.
</p>

<p>
As an experimental beta feature, Logseq Sync isn't a poster child of sync resolution (as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-Apr-09&gt;</span></span>) &#x2013; it isn't made for the purpose of simultaneous collaboration, nor is it prepared to find that someone has edited the files in Emacs while Logseq was not running.
</p>

<p>
(You'd think it would be at least on par with the simple disk file-based syncers like Syncthing and Nextcloud, but it isn't yet.)
</p>

<p>
So stay safe:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to edit only one person at a time, and ensure the sync is complete before beginning to edit.</li>

<li>Ensure the sync is complete (cloud icon turns green) before closing the app.</li>

<li>Before editing in Emacs, launch Logseq so it can sync in the background.</li>

<li>Use only one graph in Logseq, because as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-Apr-09&gt;</span></span> it only syncs the currently opened graph, leaving the others unsynced!</li>

<li>When anything feels off, or you know that one of you has created/renamed files, use the "Re-index" action.</li>

<li>Donate so Logseq Sync gets better.</li>

<li>Know how to recover.

<ul>
<li>Logseq provides a revision history, but my problem has been more that it refused to accept edits I made in Emacs while Logseq was offline, so those edits never enter the revision history to begin with.  Not much use of a revision history then&#x2026;</li>

<li>Automated Git commits (done by Emacs, not Logseq) can act as a nice safety net.  I have them anyway because it makes sense for org-roam notes, and it just takes a small initfile snippet to set up:  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meedstrom/doom.d/master/71-auto-commit.el">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meedstrom/doom.d/master/71-auto-commit.el</a></li>

<li><p>
Note that the above snippet of mine amends all commits made within the same day, so your edits can be still forgotten if you don't realize Logseq rolled-back your files before you go on to make more edits.
</p>

<p>
For me not a problem because auto-revert-mode + goggles-mode show clearly that Logseq rolled back my changes, and then the first thing I'll do is type <code>C-/</code> to undo (if the buffer was already open) or open up Magit and type <code>k</code> for "discard".
</p>

<p>
Anyway, enable the builtin Emacs backup system for safety.  On that note, have you seen <a href="https://melpa.org/#/backup-walker">backup-walker</a>?

<h5 id="orgae857ac"><a href="#orgae857ac">In case of export to HTML</a></h5>

<p>
If you ever want to export a Logseq-formatted document, Logseq has its own exporter you can use for the one-off use cases.
</p>

<p>
But if like me, you're doing a pipeline of publishing your entire org-roam directory to a blog, you'll probably choose to stick with the Org exporter.  What I do is tag the Logseq-ified files with the file-level tag <code>:logseq:</code>, I give such pages an extra CSS class (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meedstrom/doom.d/master/61-publishing.el">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meedstrom/doom.d/master/61-publishing.el</a>), so I can write custom CSS rules for them.

<h4 id="org8b2b4f6"><a href="#org8b2b4f6">Document title problems</a></h4>

<p>
Problems:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Logseq works fine without any <code>#+TITLE</code> property, but org-roam needs it.
<ul>
<li>A workaround can be to avoid file-level titles and IDs, and only use subtrees and subtree IDs.  Both programs can parse such files just fine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you create a page inside Logseq, there won't be a <code>#+TITLE</code> or file-level ID &#x2014; nor can you control the resulting filename format if that matters to you.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Solution:</b> Just don't make a habit of creating pages in Logseq.  When you do, fix the file with Emacs later.
</p>

<p>
More problems:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="3">When you rename a page in Logseq, it will change the filename.  It will <b>not</b> change the <code>#+TITLE</code> property!
<ul>
<li>(The darnedest thing is that it'll add a meaningless <code>:title:</code> property inside the file-level property drawer, which must be a bug because org-mode generally doesn't do anything with this property.  Probably an oversight by a mainly-Markdown dev.  May be the same issue behind the phantom blank line mentioned earlier.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Renaming in Logseq also changes the filename, which you may not want.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Solution:</b> don't ever rename pages through the UI, do it by tapping on the property drawer at the top of the page to reveal the <code>#+TITLE</code> and editing that.  Yes, you'll have to instruct your partner to do this, or you can just fix all the renames later.
</p>

<p>
More problems:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="5">When you link a page in Logseq by typing square brackets &#x2026; the on-disk result isn't an org-id <code>id:</code> link.
<ul>
<li>My working solution is to just fix later in Emacs, but that's not tenable if you regularly edit many files in Logseq.  Then look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/zot/ddf1a89a567fea73bc3c8a209d48f527">Bill Burdick's snippet</a> or <a href="https://github.com/idanov/org-roam-logseq.el">this derivative</a>.</li>

<h3 id="org301a648"><a href="#org301a648">Newlines</a></h3>

<p>
There are two keys that can create a newline, with different effects (just like you have <code>RET</code>, <code>M-RET</code>, <code>M-S-RET</code> in org-mode).  On the desktop Logseq app, they're <code>Return</code> and <code>Shift+Return</code>.  The first is context-aware and very happy to create new subtrees, so as an org-roam writer you probably want to just <b>avoid Return</b>.
</p>

<p>
Before you ding the devs for this oddness, these keys are actually in line with convention for modern UI, in a way.  Think of what you do in a chat app: if you want to send your chat message, you press <code>Return</code>.  If you just want to make a newline without sending, you press <code>Shift+Return</code>.  It's the same here.
</p>

<p>
However, on mobile it's the inverse.  Chat apps have a dedicated Send button, so the onscreen keyboard's return key just prints a newline.  In Logseq Mobile, <b>it's instead the onscreen keyboard's return key that has magic behavior</b>.  The equivalent to polite old <code>Shift+Return</code> is present as a button just above the screen keyboard.
</p>

<section class="odd">
<h3 id="org080b6f8"><a href="#org080b6f8">Plain checkbox lists</a></h3>

<p>
How to insert checkboxes in the app?
</p>

<p>
First, there's a long-unfixed bug (<a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/3147">https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/3147</a>).  You'll have more success writing list bullets as <code>+</code> instead of the more conventional <code>-</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
+ [ ] i am a list item
</pre>


<p>
Second, you have to <b>type the first list-item manually</b>, but after that, just enter newlines to autocreate more items.
</p>

<p>
Third, there are no indent/outdent commands for lists (only for subtrees).  To make a sub-list, you have to manually prepend two spaces, but after that, you can once again enter newlines to autocreate new items at the correct indentation.
</p>

<p>
(It's telling that this is still better UX than any other Org app I've tried&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
Fourth, you'll sometimes see list items not being rendered as such.  This isn't necessarily a bug, it can be that <b>you tried to write a list item as the first text of a subtree</b>&#x2026; meaning you actually wrote a heading that happens to start with a dash character!  Think logically about the underlying Org file.
</p>

</section>
<section class="odd">
<h3 id="org1bc5269"><a href="#org1bc5269">Slash-commands</a></h3>

<p>
For someone who only uses the mobile app (and not desktop Logseq), this feature is so <i>non-discoverable</i> I'm impressed.  In short, you should know there's a bunch of commands you can call by typing a slash character (<code>/</code>) anywhere (yes, on mobile too), and some others by typing an opening angle bracket (<code>&lt;</code>).  You can even add new commands in <code>config.edn</code>.  Do with that info what you will.

</p>

<pre class="example">
:hidden ["/page/contents.org" "/page/favorites.org"]
</pre>


<p>
Anyway, you can just cope with this by using them.  They're magic files;
</p>
<ul>
<li>what goes in <code>contents.org</code> also appears in the right-hand sidebar, and far as I can tell, it's meant as a sort of master index like Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lists_of_lists">List of lists of lists</a>;</li>
<li>what goes in <code>favorites.org</code> appears in the left-hand sidebar as a favorites section.</li>

</p>

<p>
The odd thing is that you enter the journal every time the app starts up, <b>even if the journal is disabled&#x2026;!</b>

So it's not enough to put in <code>config.edn</code> this line:

<li><p>
(Logseq Sync) It's hard to delete files from multiple devices, they keep popping back if one device still has the file.  Worse, changes sometimes get undone.  It could be an issue of differing system clocks?
</p>

<p>
I suspect many issues would go away if Logseq simply read from the filesystem every time, but it seems to work with a cached image of what it <i>thinks</i> is on the filesystem (much like org-roam has its DB, which is also sometimes out of sync, but it only uses it for lookups when you're about to insert a link so causes no real problem).  As of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-Apr-11&gt;</span></span> it seems I essentially have to tap "Re-index" for good measure every time I enter the app, although even then, some changes get reverted.

So you're a fan of science, but where and how are you exposed to it?  Should you follow science-news or should you read elementary textbooks?
</p>

<p>
Elementary textbooks (about long-settled science) give you
</p>

<ul>
<li>a reasonable guarantee that this is true</li>
<li>the treasure map of how this knowledge is derived &#x2013; so you don't need authority &#x2013; complete with math where applicable (math is welcome because then mathematical logic settles it for good). <a class="pub" href="../ngcyg/nullius-in-verba">Nullius in verba</a>.</li>
<li>carefully phrased explanations for incoming students &#x2013; see also <a class="pub" href="../bhnmf/read-easier-textbooks">Read easier textbooks</a></li>
<li>experiments cited as illustration</li>
<li>practice exercises on which to test your new mastery</li>
</ul>

<p>
New discoveries are often
</p>

<ul>
<li>controversial</li>
<li>supported by only one experiment (unreplicated as yet)</li>
<li>more complicated than us laymen can understand (likewise journalists writing the summary, which will be misleading): require background knowledge
<ul>
<li>Just lose hope in journalists conveying anything well: <a class="pub" href="../ghhpy/follow-blogs-by-people-deep-in-each-field-not-news">Follow blogs by people deep in each field, not news</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>later shown wrong anyway (see <a class="pub" href="../bcbxh/science-quality-assurance#svmjg">Ioannidis 2005</a> on why)</li>
</ul>

<p>
So many people never get to see the solid stuff, let alone the subset of the solid stuff that's understandable, because it isn't breaking news.  Yet, it's the solid stuff that's most exciting &#x2013; it's concentrated wisdom compiled by the human race.
</p>

<p>
Most understandable tends to be the stuff that came first historically, that don't require knowing about fifty other discoveries to understand.  <a class="pub person stub" href="../tysyz/archimedes">Archimedes (285&#x2013;212 BCE)</a> discovered why boats float (displacement): this, you can test in your own bathtub.
</p>

<p>
Rainbows, you can also make on sunny days with a spray of water, and you can play with prisms to understand pretty well what's going on, although there's a much longer story behind their full explanation (and to fully satisfy the student, you must get down to the level of questions such as "why can light be considered as waves and what does that even mean?" and "how come photons collide with those electron shells (<a class="pub stub person" href="../bsjzc/niels-bohr">Bohr model</a>) when electrons are so tiny the photon ought to just zip through the entire H<sub>2</sub>O molecule?").  The Archimedes one on boats seems to need much fewer questions to build a fully satisfactory "aha".

<title>What's an ideal reasoner?</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/xkjjh/ideal-reasoner" />
<id>urn:uuid:7e91380a-d25f-4797-9eca-88eae508a5f7</id>
<published>2023-01-04T12:00:00Z</published>
<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
Sometimes it's useful to talk about what an ideal reasoner would do in a situation, but isn't it subjective?  No, if by "ideal reasoner" we're talking about a being that, as efficiently as possible, solves the problem of satisfying their desires.
</p>

<p>
Sidenote: That can be confusing, because as humans, when we hear a person using language such as "efficiently optimize for my desires" we may picture an egotistical sociopath.  And that may be reasonable in everyday contexts&#x2026; but think yourself into philosophy discussion at the university, where they use words very exactly.  What does it mean to optimize for your desires or goals?
</p>

<p>
It just means the same thing we all try to do all the time: a vegan optimizes for the goal of lessening animal suffering, etc.
</p>

<p>
Human goals may be often fuzzy and self-contradictory, but rarely can a human's set of goals be described as completely selfish.  So "efficient optimization" or "ideal reasoning" is not about that.
</p>

<p>
Ideal reasoning just means, if for example you want to rule the world, figuring out the shortest path to do so that's still aesthetic to you (destroying the world with nukes can be a quick way to rule it, but that may not be what you actually want, so you rule that path out).  Or if you want to end animal farming, then ideal reasoning means figuring out the shortest way to bring about <i>that</i> result.  Or if you want good friends, then ideal reasoning is finding a practical way to get good friends into your life.  And so on.
</p>

<p>
With that definition in mind, there are all sorts of logical proofs about how an ideal reasoner would treat the information they have and any new information received.  Failing to act according to these proofs opens up for taking sub-optimal actions (<a class="private stub" href="../twlxq/dutch-booking">Dutch-booking</a>)&#x2026; and human beings can and often do act <b>so sub-optimally</b> that they fail at their quest!
</p>

<p>
Yet, we do know many basic principles of ideal reasoning!  They just tend to hard to apply faithfully, due to computational limits, cognitive biases and self-defeating psychology.
</p>

<p>
How do we know about those principles?  There's a whole tower of prescriptions arising from probability theory, decision theory and game theory, resting atop a small set of mathematical axioms and consistent with them and each other.  Philosophers have thought about this sort of thing for a long time, and the only real way to reject a given prescription of probability theory is to reject one of the axioms it rests on, such as the staggeringly basic axiom of modus ponens: "if A implies B, and I learn A is true, then I also know B is true".  As you can imagine, it'll look pretty ridiculous to try to deny any of them.  And then, upon <i>not</i> denying any of them, the rest follows.

<title>Using KMonad with an unidentifiable Bluetooth keyboard</title>

<p>
Normally, you specify which physical keyboard KMonad should apply its rules to, through an address on Linux <code>/dev/input/by-id/...</code>.   Some Bluetooth keyboards are made wrong and don't get a persistent ID.  What can you do then?
</p>

<p>
Here's the Bash script I run after every connect to find it by heuristic.  I'm quite proud of it :-)

That's not the whole story yet.  The kmonad config (again <code>/home/kept/sysconf/kmonad/trust.kbd</code>, named after the cheap &amp; bad Trust Bluetooth Keyboard&#x2014;don't buy it) also needs an edit, so that it contains the magic string <code>$MY_KBD</code> in the device-file declaration:

<h3 id="org2d7f06c"><a href="#org2d7f06c">Org-roam causes less complications than Denote</a></h3>

<p>
<a class="pub tag" href="../lpzvv/emacs">#emacs</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote">Denote</a> is &#x2026; simple in the wrong way, in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
Aside: I like the author, but I disagree with his view of when to use Org, just because of a complicated codebase.  My plaintext has no reason <i>not</i> to be in Org markup!
</p>

<p>
(Even if all copies of org-mode.el in the world got deleted or something, it would still have no reason not to be in Org markup over any other!  I could probably fork <code>markdown-mode</code> to understand Org syntax in a day, and then I'd once again be at least feature-par with markdown files, and so there's no reason to even "preventatively" stick with Markdown today.)
</p>

<p>
It sounds like to him, Org's complexity feels very present while editing an Org file, but it's not to me.  I do not see anything but the text I'm wanting to write.
</p>

<p>
I was troubled by the introduction of a <code>denote:</code> link type, worrying how they would survive export, but I'm calmed since I read that you don't need them; Denote will also read regular <code>id:</code> links.
</p>

<p>
The strict filename structure creates a roadblock for me.  I export much of my Org-roam files to a directory of HTML files, and I rely on the Org exporter to resolve <code>id:</code> links and replace them with relative paths.  Which means the actual filenames end up determining the URL to each of my post &#x2013; and I don't want the Denote format in the URL!  Now I cannot just use org export as a drop-in.  Now I must dig into the source code and hack it to work with Denote's limitations.
</p>

<p>
Now here's why I call it not-simple.  I think simple software allows seamless composition with other software, instead of creating roadblocks!
</p>

<p>
Org-roam v2 is the most natural way I can see to implement a zettelkasten.  I've thought so at least since <a class="private daily" href="../gphhm/2015-05-20">2015-05-20</a> (predating org-roam).
</p>

<p>
Most complaints I've seen have less to do with technical tradeoffs, and more to do with people not knowing what to do when they can do everything.  They like Denote because its limitations lead to someone writing a manual explaining one correct usage, and I guess people who have not previously thought much about file-naming schemes perk up at the "hey, that's smart!" file naming scheme, and so they feel compelled to buy into it just to pay respect to beauty, or something.
</p>

<p>
One complaint of org-roam is potential desync between filename and <code>#+TITLE</code>.  I'm not worried about that because when I retitle a note, I have a small command for renaming the file based on that.  And even that is something I just do for the purpose of my website.  In my mind, my notes don't have filenames.  My filesystem thinks they do, but what my filesystem thinks is inconsequential.

Even if you don't endorse your feelings, you can still share them &amp; say you're conflicted about them.  Better than staying quiet.  In fact I expect that sharing gets you 80% of the way to solving whatever interpersonal issues would have come of it.

<p>
Paraphrasing a story someone told on HN: "everyone brags that they hire only the top 1% of developers.  Problem is that can't be true, if 100% of the developers here get hired eventually." What's happening is that every time they decide to hire someone,, they filter out 99% of what's left on the market and find someone. Then another company filters out 99% of what's left after that, and so on&#x2026; until all developers have been distributed equally among the companies.
</p>

<p>
A lot of work for nothing?  Why not skip filtering?
</p>

<p>
Maybe it's that if one company doesn't bother to filter, they will end up with a worse crop over time than the others.  (Assuming that filtering is possible, but that's another topic.)

Better to model them as they are, not put yourself in their shoes.  Trust less in instinctive empathy, more intellectual: "what do I know about how this person prefers to deal with this kind of situation&#x2026;?"
</p>

<p>
I figure it's a reason why psychopaths can manipulate people so well &#x2013; they always operate by the platinum rule, as they never had the option of "put yourself in their shoes" in the first place.
</p>

<p>
The golden rule only works between people who think very alike, and the more dissimilar you are, the more important to upgrade to the platinum rule.

</p>


<p>
I understand the above is typical of auditory processing disorder (APD), occurring in a subset of people with <a class="fren" href="../jtcqq/on-adhd">ADHD</a>.  I suspect it's not actually about audio and more about language processing, because it happens with sign language too (for me).
</p>

<p>
I can have trouble listening to someone for especially long without spinning up a parallel track of thought.  When I watch video I like to have my fingers on the speed control (varying video speed between 1.5x to 5x depending on the scene) to keep myself fully stimulated.
</p>

<p>
People talk so slow, especially in professional film.
</p>

<p>
Exceptions occur with people I like a lot, who don't need to talk fast with me, because I can spend the leftover part of my consciousness on just enjoying my connection with them.  Or if I drink alcohol, I can just enjoy its buzz.
</p>

<p>
I can also feel slow at translating words into meaning.  The meme community calls this <a class="pub" href="../tjvvm/buffering">Buffering</a>, waiting for the brain to receive the message, and sometimes the lag is significant (up to 10 seconds).  It's not that I'm being distracted.  I remember hearing the sounds in your sentence and I've even recognized every word.  It's just that those words carry no meaning at all for a while, until the appropriate part of my brain is plugged in.  Then I go "oh, yeah yeah sorry, I'm with you now".
</p>

<p>
I've found it helps if I don't watch someone's face but an empty spot next to them, as looking at someone's face makes my brain reserve a majority of CPU cycles on spinning its wheels doing nothing.
</p>

<p>
Subtitled video doesn't have these problems so much.

<title>Invisible browser tabs get rid of the problem</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/wgfjk/no-tabs-in-firefox" />

<p>
People have strong opinions about tabs. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39428409">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39428409</a>
</p>

<p>
Vertical tabs?  Horizontal tabs?  Both camps find the other incomprehensible.  Maybe both are making a valid observation when they react that way to each other!
</p>

<p>
Having used the following design a while, it feels better in every way:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Hide the tab bar (you can still cycle tabs with hotkey Ctrl+Tab)</li>
<li>(Optional) Get an extension such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-list-button">Tab List Button</a>
<ul>
<li>You won't need it as often as you think &#x2013; I forgot I had it for months.  But it's there when you want some sort of overview.</li>
<li>Alternative: a tab sidebar that auto-hides.  I don't recommend it unless you're already addicted to vertical tabs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Think about it: why do the tabs need to be visible <i>all the time</i>?  Isn't that just strange?  It's like saying the Start Menu should be constantly open.

<title>Questions hearing people ask me</title>

<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<ul>
<li>No, you don't need to hear to drive a car</li>
<li>No, the hearing aids don't let me hear perfectly
<ul>
<li>I have no easy answer to "how much do I hear?".  It's not as if the deaf just need to blast higher volumes into their ears in order to experience things like hearing people.  The hearing aids take me to 100% of normal volume-experience as far as I know, but I lack some ability to differentiate sounds.
<ul>
<li>It's like with learning to walk; in your childhood, you trained your brain to differentiate sounds, so now it doesn't even seem to you like it could be difficult.</li>
<li>For an analogy, imagine cases like when a Spanish expat lives in Sweden for years and never learns to differentiate between the Swedish vowels <code>i</code> and <code>y</code>, even though native Swedes insist these are totally different sounds and impossible to mistake.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Yes, I can hear some things with my unaided ears.  Almost no one is stone-deaf, just like almost no one is so blind they can't at least see some basic shapes and contours.  I may hear passing cars (at a 2-meter distance), fire alarms (not too high-pitched ones), a kettle falling on the floor while I'm in the same kitchen.  It makes a huge difference how far away the sound is.
<ul>
<li>On a typical day without hearing aids, if I stay home, I estimate I'll hear 0-2 sounds total for that day.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Yes, lip-reading is a thing, but it's not like the movies where someone can follow a complete conversation from 30 meters away by lip-reading.  But it is an aid.  I combine hearing aids with lip-reading, so it always helps if you face me and talk clearly (move your lips and say whole words).</li>
<li>How to say "cheers" in sign language?  You don't, you just clink the glasses.</li>
<li>How to say "hi" in sign language?  Wave your hand!</li>
<li>How to say "bye" in sign language?  &#x2026;Wave your hand!</li>
</ul>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="org22cf750"><a href="#org22cf750">How to include me?</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn some sign.  This situation isn't the same as when you're dealing with a foreigner who hasn't yet learned the language of the land.  Quoting Loni Friedmann, "the hearing can learn to sign, but <b>the deaf cannot learn to hear.</b>"
<ul>
<li>Some of us can fake it convincingly &#x2013; carry on a conversation in speech &#x2013; but it always takes more effort, and we will still miss things.  I for one don't want to ask about every single thing I missed, and as a result I rarely know 100% what's going on, which means that for any given sentence you say, I'm missing some context with which to correctly interpret the sentence.  Imagine going on like that, making qualified guesses for hundreds of sentences.
<ul>
<li>With larger groups, it's worse.  For an idea of the effort needed, sometimes I have a group lunch with (hearing) friends who afterwards want to go out for some sort of activity, but I want to take a nap because I'm already exhausted from following the lunch conversations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A good start is if you learn the hand alphabet, because then I can simply teach you, mid-conversation, the signs for words after you spell them out for me, and our conversations will become faster and faster as your vocabulary grows in that way.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a group: try to talk one person at a time, especially if we're using a voice-transcription app: the app gets completely useless as soon as anyone speaks over someone else.</li>
<li>Enunciate: move your lips and speak aloud the whole word.  I'm worse at parsing your speech than Siri on your phone is.  Please compensate as if you're using a speech transcription program on a 2005 IBM desktop.</li>
<li>If you switch language for any reason, please signal that you're doing so, otherwise I'll just continue trying to fit the sounds you're making to English words I know.  You know when you use Google Translate set to French and throw in a word from another language and then it makes some bizarre guess?  Exactly.</li>
<li>One of the nicest dinners I ever had was in a group of 4 (one friend, two strangers, and myself), who stopped the whole conversation every time I expressed any confusion, to make sure I understood in fullest detail.  The conversation progressed slowly, but they didn't seem the least bit bothered about the slowness: it's easy to have a good time anyway!  So calm down a bit and focus on company and less on the verbal machine guns.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A friend said: <b>It's never the responsibility of the less-privileged to make others include them</b>.  If you think about it, isn't it absurd to expect them to?
</p>
<ul>
<li>So when you're in a situation where someone is being unintentionally left-out of your group in some way, and you don't know how to help the situation, it's still basically <i>your</i> job to figure out how.  If not, whose job is it?  You can't leave it up to that person to elbow their way in &#x2013; it's much easier for you to make a move than for them to make a move.
<ul>
<li>Of course, you may see an individual elbow their way in anyway, but that's them putting in effort and probably benefitting from individual skill and experience.  To expect this as normal would be selection bias.  Others exist with the same disprivileges and lack such resources, thus they aren't even there&#x2014;you've never met them&#x2014;because they learned long ago not to bother with such environments.</li>
<li>When someone is excluded, an easy start can be to simply ask what they need.  Although be prepared that they may not know the answer themselves.  It's not their job to know it either.</li>

<title>Schedule "fights"/check-ins</title>

<blockquote>
<p>
If scheduling a fight seems a little bit absurd, just imagine the results of letting the tension build for several days because you <i>haven’t</i> made time to argue.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is usually helpful to schedule a time to fight and make an agreement to do so; it does not promote constructive hostilities if we waylay our partner in the bathroom or on the way out the door to work. We need to schedule discussions at a time when we can give them our full attention.
</p>

<p>
Scheduling fights has the added advantage that you can prepare for them, organize your thoughts, and know you have a time when this particular issue will be dealt with. If you feel bad about the grocery bills on Tuesday, and you know you have a date to fight about it on Thursday, it’s pretty easy to put your stuff aside until then. Most people don’t put their stuff aside very well when it seems that their issues will never get dealt with.

<li>In Dune, a Truthsayer learns to tell truth from lies by speaking only truth so much that they detect its absence.  While not realistic, it's a beautiful idea.</li>
<li>Reading 2001 (the book aged better than the film) was a magical experience.  Part of learning <a class="pub stub" href="../vtvpn/joy-in-the-merely-real">Joy In the Merely Real</a>.</li>

<li>Greg Egan writes totally possible worlds.  Part of <a class="pub stub" href="../vysdm/bind-yourself-to-reality">Binding yourself to reality</a>, one of those hidden-core-of-rationality things.  We should not have to hear about impossible worlds to feel wonder.  The fact it seems so many people have a habit of only turning on their wonder-emotion when hearing impossible fiction seems tied to the fact almost no-one "looks at the world as if they've never seen it before".  Someone said: "When people praise me for that, it's a nice compliment, but wait &#x2013; actually, I <b>haven't</b> seen it before.  What, did everybody else get a preview?"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Move past "savannah poets".  The ability to write hard sci-fi (let alone rationalfic) makes for a litmus test on authors:  the main reason authors don't write hard sci-fi, is that they can't: they are savannah poets, retelling the same old Great Stories that find a form or another in every culture that has ever existed: stories on love, loss, vengeance, jealousy et cetera.  Savannah poets can anthropomorphize Jupiter just fine, but fall silent if forced to regard Jupiter a spinning ball of gas, knowing not what to do with that.  It takes a developed and scientifically up-to-date mind to begin to have a chance of describing a possible world rather than yet another impossible world&#x2014;the latter is easy.  You're liable to draw moral lessons from the fiction you read (even just subconsciously, see availability heuristic), so if you're gonna read fiction anyway, why not minimize exposure to authors with the same old systematic misunderstandings of reality that's been all too common over the past thousand generations?</li>

</p>

<p>
I use org-roam, so I'm mainly aware of note titles encoded inside the file as a #+TITLE property.  The on-disk filename means nothing.  Under this paradigm, there's no reason to ever rename files &#x2013; they may as well be named by a random string, right?
</p>

<p>
However, a descriptive filename is useful if you publish your notes to a website: the filename will be part of the web address!
</p>

<p>
So without further ado, here's a command.

<title>The same cause underlies both the availability heuristic and the conjunction fallacy</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/vcqqs/the-same-cause-underlies-both-the-availability-heuristic-and-the-conjunction-fallacy" />

Root problem: to judge how likely something is, <b>we sub in a judgment about representativeness</b>, i.e. characteristicness.
</p>

<p>
See how this looks in two different failure modes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Availability heuristic: To judge the actual rates of homicide, we trust in how typical it feels to encounter reports of homicide.</li>
<li>Conjunction fallacy: To judge the likelihood of "Poland is invaded followed by a breakdown of relations with the Soviet Union", we trust in how typical the sequence of events feels.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While the standard antidote to the conjunction fallacy is to learn to react to details as additional burdens, and there are multiple band-aids for the <a class="pub" href="../fddkv/availability-heuristic">Availability heuristic</a>, maybe we can also get to the root of the problem.
</p>

<p>
Which is&#x2026;that our inner simulator loves to compare against 'typicality clusters'?  And it's easy to see why if you think of it as implementing a neural net: light up more nodes, stronger sense of recognition.
</p>

<p>
Can we get it to habitually wire up a different sort of neural net?
</p>

<p>

<p>
Not sure where I'm going with that.

<p>
Hello.  On this homepage, I publish some of my notes.
</p>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="org8793fa0"><a href="#org8793fa0">Notes of what?</a></h2>

<p>
What not?  They can include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>study notes, taken while I learn</li>
<li>guides / tips</li>
<li>cheatsheets</li>
<li>observations</li>
<li>movie lists and other attempts to systematize the world</li>
<li>questions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of all, <b>it's not a blog</b>.  Blogs tend to peg each post to a point in time, so that they age like milk and not like wine.  That's the "stream" in <a class="pub" href="../nbgks/the-garden-and-the-stream">The Garden and the Stream</a>.  I always saw more sense in the "garden" a.k.a. evergreen/<a href="https://gwern.net/about#long-content">long content</a>, where you continually reuse, refine and extend your pages.
</p>

<p>
If there's any guiding principle, it's Luhmann's "zettelkasten", which translates to "slipbox" (<a class="pub dontgraph" href="../mrrkj/portal-slipbox">Portal: Slipbox</a>), though as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-Nov-23&gt;</span></span> I think future-me wouldn't call this a good slipbox just yet.
</p>

<p>
It may make sense to realize <b>the notes existed before the website, they're not written for it</b>.   I was writing them anyway, for my own purposes.  
</p>

</section>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="orgab30259"><a href="#orgab30259">Why write that much?</a></h2>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Writing enables <a class="pub" href="../wrdln/complex-thoughts-require-writing">more complex thoughts</a>.</li>
<li>It answers <a class="pub" href="../jpwsv/how-always-have-interesting-conversations">how to always have interesting conversations</a>.  I've often felt stumped on contributing to a conversation because I have trouble explaining my thinking in real time without having first explored the topic by writing.</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="orgfaae365"><a href="#orgfaae365">But why publish everything?</a></h2>

<p>
My original motivation was rooted in <a class="fren" href="../jtcqq/on-adhd">ADHD</a>.  When talking to therapists, I wanted to give them a way to pick through my brain for a more complete picture.
</p>

<p>
I also expect it to help me form stronger bonds with my friends, and uplift debates to the level where I present the edges of my own understanding, to learn new things.
</p>

<section class="odd">
<h3 id="org099b05c"><a href="#org099b05c">Side-effects</a></h3>

<p>
I've found some other benefits of publishing:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>My writing has improved.  When something is public, you put an extra critical eye to it.</li>
<li>I've become more rigorous as well as capable of nuance.  As you re-explain your beliefs on a web page, you realize that you've held some beliefs far too tightly, that they were even more vague than you feared (<a href="https://justintrouble.substack.com/p/extremism-and-the-unread-library">unread library effect</a>), and as you cut that stuff, you change on the inside.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="orge444fb0"><a href="#orge444fb0">How'd you make this website?</a></h2>

<p>
What you're seeing is a Svelte app in a Docker image hosted on Google Cloud Run, where I also rent the domain name.  Source code: <a href="https://github.com/meedstrom/svelte-frontend">https://github.com/meedstrom/svelte-frontend</a>
</p>

<p>
The notes themselves, I write as plaintext files-on-disk according to the conventions of <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">org-roam</a>.
</p>

<p>
When it's time to update the website, I follow these steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In Emacs, run <code>M-x org-publish</code> to turn my org-roam files into HTML files.
<ul>
<li>custom org-publish config: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meedstrom/doom.d/master/61-publishing.el">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meedstrom/doom.d/master/61-publishing.el</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run a local Node.js script that packs the resulting collection of HTML files into a <code>posts.json</code> and put it into the frontend's assets folder.</li>
<li>Rebuild and push the Docker image to Google Cloud Run with the commands <code>gcloud builds submit &amp;&amp; gcloud run deploy</code>.</li>

<title>Garden-path sentences</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/tttww/garden-path-sentences" />
<id>urn:uuid:5a2084c1-021b-42ab-8ef2-769c646b4bbc</id>
<published>2023-10-23T12:00:00Z</published>
<updated>2023-10-23T12:00:00Z</updated>
<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Ref.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentencef">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence</a></p><p>
If you can understand the sentences in the list below, congrats!  You're great at English!  Most natives have to read them twice or thrice or ten times before they get it.
</p>

<p>
Here's where encoding spoken language in written form <i>really</i> breaks down, beyond just the usual failure to encode sounds faithfully.  In these examples, it would be really important to write out the length of delay between words and which words are said with stress or intonation.  It's easier to understand when spoken out loud.
</p>

<ul>
<li>"The old man the boat."</li>
<li>"The horse raced past the barn fell."</li>
<li>"Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana."</li>
<li>"The complex houses married single soldiers and their families."</li>
</ul>

<p>
See explanations below.  But first, <b>try to understand for yourself!</b>
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Explanations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>"The old man the boat."
<ul>
<li>the old people are manning the boat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"The horse raced past the barn fell."
<ul>
<li>You know the horse that was made to race past the barn? Yeah, that horse, it fell down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana."
<ul>
<li>this is a pointless sentence meant to confuse you, but it says that time passes fast, and also, that fruit flies enjoy bananas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"The complex houses married single soldiers and their families."
<ul>
<li>i.e. there are married soldiers living in the apartment complex (or in some other type of building that can be called a 'complex'), and they are living there together with their families, and there are not multiple soldiers and families per apartment but only one (thus 'single')</li>
</ul></li>

Excerpts and takeaways from Nate Soares' excellent "Replacing Guilt" series.

<p>
Thank you, Nate! In my judgment, your posts have made a bigger impact on my agency than anything else I've read, heard or seen.

<h2 id="hqrjn"><a class="pub" href="#hqrjn">When you say "I should do X", you make it unpleasant both to do X and to not</a></h2>

<p>
When you think "I should do X", and you aren't quite conscious of how bad it would be to just skip it, you risk growing to <span class="underline">resent the obligation</span>.<sup>1697591941271</sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I see lots of guilt-motivated people use “shoulds” as ultimatums: “either I get the meds, or I am a bad person.”  They leave themselves only two choices: go out of their way on the way to work and suffer through awkward human interaction at the pharmacy, or be bad.  <b>Either way, they lose:</b> the should has set them up for failure.
</p>

<p>
But the actual options aren’t “suffer” or “be bad.”  The actual options are “incur the social/time costs of buying meds” or “incur the physical/mental costs of feeling ill.”  It’s just a choice: you weigh the branches, and then you pick.  <b>Neither branch makes you “bad.”  It’s ok to decide that the social/time costs outweigh the physical/mental costs.</b>  It’s ok to decide the opposite.  Neither side is a “should.”  Both sides are an option.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps the should unpacks into “I want to finish this paper, because if I don’t, then I will very likely fail my course, lose my scholarship, get kicked out of college, disappoint my parents, and destroy my job prospects.”  The alternative options might be <i>really bad.</i>  Yet, I claim that there is power in laying them all out, <a class="pub" href="#hyjls">no matter how bad they are</a>.  Make the values finite, so you can actually weigh them on your scales.  When you "should" yourself without looking at the alternatives, you run a high risk of making yourself feel obligated and resentful.

<p>
Every time you say aloud or think of a task you've committed to, it feels lighter if you also <span class="underline">take a moment</span> to say <span class="underline">why/what's it good for/what consequence will result</span> &#x2013; especially if you don't <span class="underline">have an instant answer</span>.<sup>1697591941321</sup>

<p>
Picture someone who needs to choose between playing video games all day (and losing their job) or getting abused by customers all day (for not all that much money). They conclude that they “should” do the job, and they feel compelled by the should. And then, over and over, I find my friends resenting their shoulds, as if the shoulds came from outside, from Beyond, from the Intergalactic Oughthorities. They treat their should like shackles that bind them to the “right path”, the one where they have to go to work when they could be playing video games.
</p>

<p>
But the shoulds aren’t the shackles. There aren’t any oughthorities. You always get to do as you please, within the bounds allowed by the universe.

<p>
Especially when failure is unthinkable, <span class="underline">imagine failing</span>.  The inability to do so makes it more likely.<sup>1697591941371</sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unpacking a “should” can also be very difficult for a reason that’s a little harder to articulate. Have you ever seen a person who can’t even <i>imagine</i>  the thought of failure start to fail? They start to panic, their actions get rushed, their hands start to shake (which is particularly fatal if their task is one requiring dexterity), they put on blinders to the fact that they’re about to fail as they frantically repeat an action they wish would succeed over and over.
</p>

<p>
The ironic thing is, especially in timed, dexterity-based tasks, if the person <i>didn’t</i> panic, they would have a better chance of succeeding. It seems to me that, more often than not, it’s the fact that they can’t even <i>consider</i>  their failure that is harming them most.

<p>
Visualize it in full detail. Don't need to excuse it. Don't tell yourself it wouldn't be your fault. Don't tell yourself it would be fine. Don't make up a story about how you'd handle it successfully. Just <i>imagine the worst.</i>
</p>

<p>
People close to you might get hurt. You could die. Lots of people could die. If bad outcomes are in the possibility space, internalize that <i>now.</i>  Come to terms with that terrible fact as soon as you can. You want to get into a mental state where if the bad outcome comes to pass, you will only nod your head and say "I knew this card was in the deck, and I knew the odds, and I would make the same bets again, given the same opportunities."

<blockquote>
<p>
Imagine the person who wakes up feeling a bit sick.  They may well say to themselves, “ugh, I should go to the pharmacy and pick up medication before work.”  Now picking up meds feels like an obligation: if they don’t get meds, then that’s a little bit of evidence that they’re incompetent, or akrasiatic, or bad.  Now they must go get meds, if they want to be a competent person.  In the lingo of CFAR, this “should” is the exact opposite of an urge-propagation: it disconnects the reason from the task, it abolishes the “why”.  The person feeling sick now feels like they have an obligation to pick up medication, and so if they do it, they do it grudgingly, resenting the situation.
</p>

<p>
Now imagine they say this, instead: “ugh, if I went to the pharmacy to pick up medication, I’d feel better at work today.”  Notice the difference?  Now the reason remains attached to the task.  Now neither option makes them “bad,” and both options are tradeoffs.

Don’t say “I really should finish this paper.”  Say “if I don’t finish this paper, I’ll get a worse grade than I was planning to, and my teacher will frown at me, and my parents will frown at me.”  Then weigh your options.  Then choose.

<p>
A few months ago, a friend of mine was describing her motivational issues to me. As an example, she explained she was having trouble making herself clean her room, despite her dissatisfaction with the constant messiness.

I asked: “Have you considered just not forcing yourself?”
</p>

<p>
She blinked, and cocked her head at me, and said “but then my room wouldn’t get cleaned.”

<p>
I called bullshit. Because look: either (a) you stop forcing yourself to clean the room, and you realize you don’t actually care about having a clean room, and then your room stays messy <i>and that’s fine because you don’t care</i>; or (b) you stop forcing yourself to clean the room, and then you get a bit worried, because some part of you <i>actually wants the room cleaned</i>, so you listen to that part of yourself, and you work with it, and you find a time to clean the room <i>because you want to.</i>

<p>
Situation: You become aware there's a thing you've repeatedly done, and you dislike that you do it.  Well, don't <span class="underline">heap guilt on yourself</span>.  The spectre of "You Will Feel Bad" is clearly not keeping you from doing it anyway.  Instead, drop all that and just observe what pushed <span class="underline">the elephant</span> to do it this time.<sup>1697591941666</sup>

<p>
When you are feeling guilty about how you spent your time, make it go away by redirecting the guilty energy into doing a <span class="underline">postmortem</span>.<sup>1697591941722</sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Guilt is one of those strange tools that works by <i>not</i>  occurring. You place guilt on the branches of possibility that you don’t want to happen, and then, if all goes well, those futures don’t occur. Guilt is supposed to steer the future towards non-guilty futures; it’s never supposed to be instantiated in reality.
</p>

<p>
Guilt works by the same mechanism as threats: imagine the tribesperson who precommits to breaking the legs of anyone who steals their food. If this precommitment works, then it never needs to be carried out: violence is a dangerous business, and the tribesperson would much rather that they never need to break legs at all. &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Imagine, by contrast, the tribesperson who threatens to break the legs of anyone who looks at them funny: they might find themselves attempting violence every single day, and this likely makes their life unpleasant, to say the least. In this case, I would argue that they’re using their threats poorly. I would say that, if you keep finding yourself carrying out a threat, then you really need to consider whether or not your threats are really capable of steering the future in the way you hoped.
</p>

<p>
Guilt is the same way: <i>if you find yourself regularly experiencing guilt, then you’re using guilt incorrectly.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So then what's the alternative?  Science!  Be a scout, not a torturer:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When you find yourself binging netflix, don’t heap loads of guilt on yourself post-binge. That sort of thing clearly doesn’t prevent the binge. Instead, say to yourself, “huh, I appear to netflix-binge under certain conditions, despite the fact that I’d rather not. I wonder which conditions, specifically, led to that binge! What were the triggers? How could they have been avoided? What methods might help me avoid binging in the future?”
</p>

<p>
And then treat it like an experiment! Write up your hypotheses. Experiment with many different ways to fix your glitches. Write postmortems when you fail. If you attempt a fix and then find yourself binging <i>again</i>, then don’t heap loads of guilt on yourself! <i>That still doesn’t help.</i>

<p>
(Applicable to <a class="fren" href="../dgjpf/diet-ethics">Diet ethics</a>)
</p>

<p>
When resenting your shoulds, recall that they don't come from <span class="underline">outside you</span>.<sup>1697591941771</sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve seen many people use the word “should” to highlight a conflict between what they perceive as desires and what they perceive as moral obligations. For example, they might say “well I <i>want</i> to buy this ice cream, but I <i>should</i>  donate the money to the Against Malaria Foundation instead.”
</p>

<p>
I say, this is a false conflict. Imagine this person precommiting to never doing anything just because they “should.” How might they feel?
</p>

<p>
They might feel relieved, because they <i>actually didn’t</i>  care about helping others, not even a little bit. So they discharge their guilt, buy their ice cream, and go on their merry way.
</p>

<p>
But more likely (in someone who thought they “should” give to AMF), that would feel a little bad, and a little hollow. This person, when committing to never do things because they “should,” might feel a bit of fear. They might worry that if they didn’t keep themselves in check then they’d <i>never</i>  do anything to help those less fortunate than themselves. That might seem bad, to them.
</p>

<p>
Which lets them actually see the true problem, for the first time: they <i>both</i> want to buy the ice cream <i>and</i>  help those who are worse off than them. Now they can actually weigh both desires on the scales, or search for clever third options that fulfill both desires, and so on.
</p>

<p>
This is a big part of where guilt-free effective altruism comes from, I think: instead of forcing yourself to give to charities sporadically when the guilt overcomes you, promise yourself that you <i>won’t</i> give sporadically due to guilt, and then <i>listen</i> to the part of you that says “but then when will I help others!?” Don’t force yourself to be an altruist — instead, commit to <i>never</i> forcing yourself, and then work with the part of you that protests, and become an altruist <i>if and only if you want to help.</i>

<h2 id="qvply"><a class="pub" href="#qvply">Is there ever a point to the word "should"?</a></h2>

<p>
Basically, it's for retrospectives.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A commenter to my last post said: <i>There’s some meaning lost when you go from “I should X” to “If I X, I will achieve Y”, which is “And I want to achieve Y enough to X, that’s the best of the options.”</i>
</p>

<p>
I think this is mostly correct. Only mostly, because as far as I can tell most people don’t tend to use “I should X” to mean “X is my best option.” More frequently, I see people use it to mean “I would conclude that X is my best option <i>if I knew more facts</i>,” or “I would conclude that X is my best option <i>if I thought longer/”, or “I would conclude that X is my best option /if I really cared about what I say I care about</i> .”
</p>

<p>
Regardless, all these various interpretations of “I should X” share one property: It’s extremely difficult to make these claims about X <i>while you’re still deliberating.</i>
</p>

<p>
If you ever happen to figure out which option is best, then don’t slap the label “should” on it and go back to thinking about your options! If you know what the best option is, then stop deliberating and <i>do it.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>After</i> the fact, looking back, you are welcome to say “ah, knowing what I know now, I see that pressing the green button would have been better.” But <i>in the moment</i> , all you can do is evaluate all of your actions and see which one looks best given the information available. Shoulds are for retrospectives, not for deliberation.

Once you’ve cashed out a should, you’re often left with conflicting interests (remember that it’s quite possible to disagree with yourself!

Frequently, after unpacking a should you’re still left with a really hard choice. Furthermore, it’s also quite common to cash a should out, weigh both options, decide that one option is better, and then <i>still find yourself doing the worse thing.</i> (This last problem is a doozy, and I’ll discuss it more in future posts.)

<h2 id="mzfhp"><a class="pub" href="#mzfhp">What a true moral impulse feels like</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
The things that you feel resentment towards are false shoulds, or at least twisted shoulds. Encountering one of your <i>actual</i> moral bonds feels very different indeed. A true opportunity to execute a moral commitment feels not like an obligation, but like a <i>priviledge</i>. It feels like executing a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">Screw The Rules I’m Doing What’s Right</a> trope.
</p>

<p>
In fiction, picture the moment when the villain reveals that doing the Right Thing will start a war, and the hero sets their jaw, looks them in the eyes, and says “so be it,” and then does the right thing anyway.
</p>

<p>
In real life, think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irena_Sendler">Irena Sendler</a>, who smuggled thousands of Jewish children to safety during the holocaust, who was captured by the Nazis and tortured and had her legs broken and was sentenced to death, and who escaped anyway,
</p>

<p>
and then <i>went back.</i>
</p>

<p>
Imagine what was going through her mind, when she decided to go back and save more people. Now, of course, I have no idea what she was actually feeling, but when I imagine what it would take for <i>me</i>  to go back under those circumstances, I imagine feeling fear, and a hint of despair at finding myself still capable, but also a burning resolve to do the right thing anyway.
</p>

<p>
I imagine her feeling that having the opportunity to go back was a <i>privilege.</i> Not an external obligation whispered down from the heavens, but an internal fire, a defiance of the natural order, a need to make the world <i>different</i>  from the way it would be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Irena didn’t have an <i>obligation</i>  to keep fighting. She had more than discharged her moral duty. And while I’m willing to bet that at least part of her was scared, and at least part of her wished she had been crippled and unable to return, there was also a part of her that didn’t look at the opportunity to return to save more children as a misfortune, but as an honor.
</p>

<p>
Can you begin to see the difference between a false should, and a true moral commitment? Think of a false should, one that gives you a strong sense of obligation and a hint of resentment (such as “finish this paper” or “go to work tomorrow”). Now imagine of Irena Sendler, offered the opportunity to return to Warsaw. Imagine what went on in her head, in that moment.
</p>

<p>
I imagine a mind afraid, but unified, because for her, it wasn’t really a choice. Innocent children were still dying, and there was only one thing to do.
</p>

<p>
<i>That’s</i>  what a true moral impulse feels like, when you find one. Not like an obligation, but like a piece of cold iron found deep in your core, the thing that you touch — or that touches you — in the moment that you really see the best option available to you, the moment that you realize you already know which way this choice is going to go.

<h2 id="jmgbk"><a class="pub" href="#jmgbk">Do I want to just be at home doing nothing?</a></h2>

<p>
Nope.
</p>

<p>
Nate talks about this misconception (<a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Kdgpm7t9gZvWncZqa/rest-in-motion">https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Kdgpm7t9gZvWncZqa/rest-in-motion</a>) and I think sometimes I fall prey to it.  But usually not.  I know I have tons of things I genuinely want to do and which I will do as soon as other completed tasks leave space for them.  I also know it's a restful existence, to just do what I want.  But often I do things I don't really want, and I may get the idea that it would be nice to let go of all obligations, but it's not towards doing nothing.  Just nothing I don't want.  Or nothing I have to push myself towards.
</p>

<p>
(Observation: Sometimes I "push" myself like when I'm learning a new tech framework, but in that situation, I want to push, so it doesn't have the same shade of unpleasantness.  I should remember that feeling for reference as a nontoxic kind of self-push.)
</p>

<p>
I note, however, that "being home alone doing what I want" may work for me as the same sort of ideal as "lying at home doing nothing" for some people.  So let me just point out now, Me, that it's not really what I want.  If I removed everything complicated from my life, like relationships, my days would be predictable but eventually I would feel incomplete.  On the other hand, having friends and lovers sometimes means difficulties.  These may feel like the kind of thing I want to minimize out of life, but I guess I welcome them even if it's not fun in the moment.

<p>
Nate says all the above ideas are basically generated from these basic lenses:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Refinement</li>
<li>Internalization</li>
<li>Realism</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p>
Use refinement (1) when you feel vaguely guilty about the recent days, overall feeling bad about yourself.  Ask the guilt what it's so embarrassed about and what it would have preferred you do instead.
</p>

<p>
Be very concrete and don't just accept "I should have been studying".  Which book? Which chapter?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, this makes you remember that none of the alternatives were compelling, that what you did made sense, and the guilt may vanish.  But often, it gets more pointed, well-defined, which gives you something to work with for the next step.

<blockquote>
<p>
Once upon a time, I had a loose date planned with a girlfriend. She was going to drop by around 21:00 to hang out. I had something else planned at 19:00 that I didn’t expect to take too long; it ended up taking many hours longer than expected. There was no particularly convenient point along the way to step out and call my girlfriend and tell her I’d be late… so I didn’t. I simply got home at 23:00 at night, opened the door, and saw my girlfriend sitting worried on the bed.
</p>

<p>
There’s a very distinct type of feeling that I experienced, there, which you might call “guilt.” Seeing her sitting there on the bed, I suddenly remembered that the anxiety and dejection that she went through was far worse than the slight awkwardness I would have incurred to call her. A compartmentalization in my head broke down, and the part of me that had <i>known</i>  she’d been feeling terrible suddenly came into mental focus. My error became obvious. The feeling was something like being punched in the gut.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I <i>also</i>  had the opportunity to feel a lingering sense of regret for days.
</p>

<p>
When I suggest removing guilt, I suggest removing the latter — but not the former. The former is quite useful.
</p>

<p>
If you worry that, by removing guilt, you will lose your ability to update when you mess up, then I say: update on the suckerpunch. Trust me, it’s strong enough. Update <i>immediately</i> when you realize where you failed, and use the terrible feeling to make sure you <i>don’t do that again.</i>
</p>

<p>
Update fully on the suckerpunch, and there will be no need for that lingering regret.

"It's your time", I told myself.
</p>

<p>
This changed the game entirely. I no longer willed myself to avoid temptation: I weighed temptations alongside my other options, took their pros and cons into account, and made an informed decision. Did I <i>need</i>  to distract myself? Sometimes, the answer was yes.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that I could no longer trust myself to bail me out if I got addicted to new media, I took special care in removing as many distractions as I could from my environment. Because I'd resolved not to spend willpower to cancel addictions, I became much more cautious at the point of entry.

We aren't here to alter the color of the fundamental "goodness" stone buried within us from red to green; life is not a game of "wind up Good at the end".  There is only what you can do and what you can't.  As a corollary, <a class="pub" href="#mfvzt">You may have a broken notion of what you "could" have done</a>.

I sometimes find myself unable to act as I wish; unresponsive to my own cajoling. I treat these not as evidence of my fundamental brokenness, but as evidence about <a href="http://mindingourway.com/where-coulds-go/">how and when I can intervene on the world</a>.
</p>

<p>
While I often fail, I do not act under fear of being judged inadequate by the universe. I may <i>be</i>  inadequate to the tasks I undertake, I may fail to steer the future as I wish to, but I cannot be “fundamentally bad.” That sentence does not parse.

<p>
It’s well and good, when introspecting about why what you’re doing is important, to get an answer from yourself that is of the form “otherwise I’ll be bad.” That’s a fine answer to get. But <i>don’t let that be the end of things.</i> Don’t pretend that that’s the final answer. <i>Investigate.</i>

If someone wants you to do the laundry, and you don’t want to do the laundry, and you get angry at them because you have a sense that if there is conflict then one of you must be bad and <i>you</i>  don’t want to be bad—

<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve met many who are under the impression that when you realize the world is in deep trouble, you’re obligated to respond by feeling more and more grim. Like a movie about a detective that’s trying to save a kidnapped child: as the detective learns that the child is in more and more danger, they lock their jaw and become more and more grim and determined. Their respite comes only when the child is rescued.
</p>

<p>
That’s narrative thinking, and we aren’t in a narrative. You can break the trope.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
I say, it’s good to have a grim-o-meter, but <i>stop calibrating it against the state of the world.</i>  That’s a terrible plan!
</p>

<p>
I mean, look at humanity at large. People are killing each other like it’s going out of style, while millions die from disease each year and civilization careens towards self-destruction.
</p>

<p>
Now look at your grim-o-meter. It has, like, seven different settings. Maybe twelve, on a good day.
</p>

<p>
That detective in the movie about the kidnapped child might be able to faithfully use a twelve-setting grim-o-meter to track the grimness of their own situation.
</p>

<p>
But the real world? The one with billions of people each with rich inner lives, and astronomical future potential hanging by a pale blue thread in Time? There’s no way you can justifiably connect a twelve-setting grim-o-meter to <i>that.</i>
</p>

<p>
And what if you could? <b>Would your grim-o-meter always be set to “maximum grimness,”</b> at least until humanity makes it through the gauntlet? That doesn’t sound very fun or useful.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
Look: that’s not what your grim-o-meter is <i>for.</i> It’s not supposed to be attached to the global state of the world. Feeling grim or carefree in proportion to the aggregate disparity or well-being on the planet is difficult, impractical, <i>and</i> mostly useless.
</p>

<p>
Your grim-o-meter is designed for <i>local</i> occasions. You need to get more grim (and more buckled down) as the work <i>immediately in front of you</i> gets harder, and you need to get less grim (so that you can spend time recharging and relaxing) whenever you have the affordance to recharge and relax. That’s the <i>point</i> of the grimness setting.
</p>

<p>
Remember, the grim-o-meter was made for you, not you for it.

<blockquote>
<p>
Imagine walking past a beggar on the street. They're dirty and downtrodden; weathered but not much older than you. They ask you for change as you pass by.
</p>

<p>
This causes a certain type of pain in people — enough pain that most people develop some sort of coping mechanism. Some people pretend they didn't see or hear the beggar. Some give an apology, some make up an excuse about not having any money. Some shove their hands in their pockets and drag out some spare change, so that they may discharge their moral duty.
</p>

<p>
Other people cope with cynicism or bitterness — the sight of a beggar reminds them of the failings of the hated out group, the people who voted for the Wrong Political Party in the local elections. Still others cope with a wave of guilt, shorting out the pain, because the guilt seems easier to bear.
</p>

<p>
My suggestion, this week, is notice that impulse.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I say: Yes, the beggar suffers. Yes, a thousand families starve. The world is hurting.
</p>

<p>
And yes, there are others who are doing more than you to help. Some are smarter, some are more productive, some were born wealthier, some are kinder, some are less psychologically fragile, some have a stronger will.
</p>

<p>
But none of these are reasons for guilt. <a href="https://mindingourway.com/dont-steer-with-guilt/">Guilt was made for us, not us for it</a>. Guilt is useful only insofar as it helps you wrest yourself from the wrong path. If you're already walking the path you want to walk, if you're working on becoming kinder, or more generous, or psychologically stronger, or wealthier, or smarter, if you're already moving as fast as you can given your current constraints, then the fact that the world is still hurting and you aren't strong enough to fix things yet is no reason for guilt.
</p>

<p>
Rather, it's a reason for <i>anger,</i> at a world where nobody is evil but everything is broken. It's a reason for <i>resolve,</i> to push yourself as hard as is healthy and sustainable <a href="https://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/">but no harder</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are dozens of opportunities to transmute guilt, or awkwardness, or not-my-problem into resolve, each day.
</p>

<p>
Notice the disabused middle-aged woman who has to sacrifice a part of her soul working a job at Starbucks in order to earn her right to survive. See the madman yelling across the street, while everyone else reflexively struggles to ignore or unsee him. See a morbidly obese person avoid the stares of onlookers as they struggle with self-loathing in a civilization that filled its cheapest foods with poisons that ravage bodies.
Some people ignore these painful parts of the world. Others try to unsee them. Others try to distance themselves, by poking fun at those who are deemed "pathetic."
</p>

<p>
I suggest seeing them, and remembering. Remember that there may come a time when humanity will move the very stars to ensure that no mind suffers as much as a first-world beggar does today. Remember that, beneath all the mental callouses that allow you to write fellow human beings off as unsalvageable, the reason you won't help them is not because they aren't worth helping, but because there are too many other things that need doing first.

"But people <i>want</i>  excuses. They're social creatures! They want to know what happened!", the one protests.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes. Sometimes people really want you to provide them some excuse, or at least some explanation. But even here, be careful: I have noticed that my friends often help me try to excuse <i>myself</i> , for one reason or another, and I think that giving in to this pressure can be harmful.
</p>

<p>
Imagine someone who failed to exit an abusive relationship, despite three years of trauma. After they successfully exit, their friends are likely to be first in line with condolences along the lines of "they were gaslighting you" and "there wasn't anything you could have done" and "how could you have known what to do?"
</p>

<p>
They are providing excuses, and these are toxic. They rob you of your power. They rob you of your ability to say "actually, I <i>could</i> have known, if I had been thinking more clearly. I <i>could</i> have acted differently, if I had known better. And that's the <i>good part</i> , because it means that I am not a helpless victim, because it means that I can learn how to become stronger. Because it means that I cannot be trapped in that sort of situation again."

Excuses rob you of your agency. Yes, many people will try to get excuses out of you, if they perceive you as putting too much pressure on yourself. <i>But that pressure is precisely the impetus to learn and adapt,</i>  and if you can

<p>
I think many people imagine the difference between trying to try and actually trying involves something like Additional Effort or Additional Willpower. It's easy to imagine someone trying to try to (say) cure aging. Maybe they flounder around a bit and talk about how they want to join a biology startup, or start a biology startup, or get a biology degree, all while really deeply wanting to find some way to cure aging. It's also easy to imagine that the person "actually trying" to cure aging is doing something similar, but with more determination and a bit of pixie dust that makes things work out. The actually-tryer does the same things, but for them, the startup works through dint of sheer willpower; or they get a biology degree while winning so many accolades that they get to set up their own laboratory.
</p>

<p>
This isn't how I imagine "actually trying." <b>It's not trying-to-try with extra gusto</b>. Actually trying looks like solving small subproblems, with the more ambitious target no longer the focus of attention, but rather <b>a background task.</b> Actually trying to cure aging doesn’t look like a person getting a biology degree with <i>especially grim determination</i>, it looks like Aubrey de Grey wading through a mountain of mundane tasks while scraping together enough money to keep <a href="https://www.sens.org">SENS</a> running.

Imagine someone who plays recreational soccer, sprinting up and down the soccer field up till the brink of exhaustion. Now imagine them not playing soccer, but just trying to sprint up and down the field up to the brink of exhaustion. They probably push themselves a lot less in the latter case. If "sprint up and down the field a lot" is the main goal, then at each possible stopping point, part of them starts trying to convince the rest that they've exercised enough for the day, and they must spend willpower to continue. In a soccer match, by contrast, the focus is elsewhere.

For the first person, “failure” is either first or second on the list of things they expect to happen next: they’re trying to solve the problem, and either they’ll solve it, or they’ll fail.

When removing ‘try’ and its synonyms from your vocabulary, you may find that <b>you can’t honestly say you’re “solving a math problem,”</b> because you have no idea whether you’ll succeed. And saying you’re “working on a math problem” is only slightly better; it’s mostly just using “working” as a synonym for “trying.”

<p>
In these cases, if you want to remove the word ‘try’, I suggest not finding a near synonym, but <b>increasing the granularity</b> of your descriptions. Don’t say “I’m trying to solve this math problem,” say “I’m transforming the problem into a programming problem so I can see it from a different angle”, or “I’m gameifying the problem so that my intuitions can get a better handle on it,” or “I’m producing random algebraic manipulations of this equation in desperate hope that one of them happens to be the answer,” or “I’m staring at the problem waiting for my gut to say something for enough time to pass that I can give up without losing face.” Describe what you’re doing on the level of granularity where at each step you describe, it would be silly to say you were “trying” at that step, [&#x2026;]

Most people, at that point, react one of two ways.
</p>

<p>
Some accept the logic and reject their intuitions. They see that, to save the most lives, they must use a price tag. It sounds repugnant to say that the pleasure experienced by a few million people drinking a can of soda is equivalent to the value of a life, but (they think) that’s exactly the sort of reasoning that leads someone to thinking that life is invaluable, which is a deadly misconception. And so, wanting to save as many people as they can with the money allotted to life-saving, they bite the bullet, and conclude that lives were never worth all that much anyway.
</p>

<p>
Others reject the logic, and continue to claim that life is invaluable, and then try to back up their intuitions with some strange version of ethics where saving as many lives as possible with the money available is not the right thing to do, for convoluted reasons.

But there’s a third option here! All these people have forgotten about the dragon!

<title>Occam's Razor not some fuzzy rule of thumb</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/sfwwz/occams-razor-not-some-fuzzy-rule-thumb" />
<id>urn:uuid:6b46d032-5310-4485-972a-abf769f5e0c2</id>

<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
Not everyone is raised to revere Occam's Razor.  To someone who wasn't, the statement "it's the simplest explanation" isn't a knockdown argument for anything.  WHy couldn't a complex explanation be correct?
</p>

<p>
So it bears explaining.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Occam's Razor is not just some fuzzy rule of thumb, it has a formalism: minimum message length (MML)!
</p>

<p>
"The woman down the street is a witch; she did it"
</p>

<p>
The above sentence looks like a short and simple theory for whatever happened, but it's far from simple.  Several of the words used, such as "witch", require <i>a lot</i> of explanation for an AI or alien who knows nothing about any of the words.  The resulting completed message, that contains all the data needed to interpret the sentence, in addition to the sentence itself, is the true MML of your theory.
</p>

<p>
If you then represent the message as binary code, you can describe its complexity in terms of bits (a log<sub>2</sub> number).
</p>

<p>
(To be fair, though it doesn't make a difference for this page, here we handwave away an important detail: the "message" would actually be a computer program (Turing machine code, I think), as that is the shortest possible way&#x2014;and a language-neutral way&#x2014;to express a theory.)
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Slightly longer messages must be taken by an <a class="pub" href="../xkjjh/ideal-reasoner">Ideal reasoner</a> as <b>exponentially</b> less likely to match reality.
</p>

<p>
Even if on one given occasion this may feel hard to justify, it's simply math, that if you have the habit of believing messages just one bit longer than the shortest one available, you'll be wrong twice as often as otherwise.  To say nothing of when the message is ten bits longer, where on average you must expect your first thousand (because 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024) theories of the same length to be proven false.
</p>

<p>
And though there's technically a way out here to save your pet theory, if you were motivated to argue it into a defensible position&#x2026; it's not valid to hope along the lines of "there's still a chance, right?" for the longer message to happen by luck to describe reality more closely.  <a class="pub" href="../qyscx/no-one-can-feel-a-probability-that-small">No one can feel a probability that small</a>, so it's more human-psychologically correct (in the sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wronger_than_wrong">that famous parable</a> by Asimov "&#x2026;wronger than both of them put together") to say that it's simply zero, i.e. to say that we actually know that the simpler explanation is correct (technically, just the most accurate by far &#x2013; until someone thinks of a theory with an even shorter MML).
</p>

<p>
This is why physicists strive so hard to find simple theories &#x2013; the simplicity is as good as <i>proof</i> it's correct!
</p>

<p>
(Why do physicists run any experiments at all then when they could just sit in an armchair crafting ever simpler theories?  Excellent question!  There's one constraint on your theory-making: you need the simplest theory that <b>still fits all the facts at hand</b>.  Otherwise you could just propose a zero-length message as explanation for everything, right?  If a theory fails to explain just one fact, it's already disproven and the answer has to be in a different theory, even if that one must be longer.  They just discount anything that's longer than necessary.  And run experiments to differentiate between theories of equal length.)
</p>

<p>
Once a simpler theory is found that fits, everyone acts like we know this theory is true, because&#x2026; we essentially do know it.
</p>

<p>
The word "know", if it's to mean anything useful, is shorthand for a sufficiently high probability &#x2013; large percentages like 99.9976%, the amount of decimals passing beyond the realm where it's psychologically realistic to keep track of the probability as a mental entity at all.  We throw it away, and that's the point where we say we "know" the attached proposition.  Although for agents with unbounded computing power, the number would always remain.
</p>

<p>
As <a class="pub person" href="../drhtx/dennis-lindley">Dennis Lindley (1923&#x2013;2013)</a> said, our theories must always allow for the possibility that the moon is made of green cheese, however tiny (Cromwell's Rule).   Most people alive today would assign such a proposition about the moon too tiny a probability to bother keeping track of &#x2013; in other words, they know perfectly well it's not made of green cheese!  If this bothers you, the issue is that the word "know" is a bit of an abomination, a shorthand for a probability hugging up against 0% or 100% with many decimals.  And the word does serve a pragmatic purpose as such a shorthand, but the vast majority of people don't think of it that way, they just hear it as absolute, so be wary.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, just as you won't bother to do an experiment to check if the moon is made of green cheese, as it's so improbable as to be not worth your time, then for the same reason, you don't bother to test or even consider any other hypotheses with long MML &#x2013; they're so improbable as to be not worth your time.
</p>

<p>
To nevertheless privilege a long-MML hypothesis and insist it be tested, you must likewise argue for checking whether the moon is cheese, and decillions of other improbable hypotheses, and then humanity has no time to do anything else.
</p>

<p>
But&#x2026; is it so bad to privilege a hypothesis "just this once"?  From <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/X2AD2LgtKgkRNPj2a/privileging-the-hypothesis">https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/X2AD2LgtKgkRNPj2a/privileging-the-hypothesis</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the minds of human beings, if you can get them to think about this particular hypothesis rather than the trillion other possibilities that are no more complicated or unlikely, you really have done a huge chunk of the work of persuasion. Anything thought about is treated as “in the running,” and if other runners seem to fall behind in the race a little, it’s assumed that this runner is edging forward or even entering the lead.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What if you have special knowledge that implies it's worth testing?  Well, that's allowed and totally OK!  Science doesn't pick sides.  But your knowledge has to have a large evidential weight to offset the long MML.  Without such weight, we're back to the previous reasoning &#x2013; it's overwhelmingly likely to just waste our time.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
If the explicit probability argument doesn't persuade you, how about track record?
</p>

<p>
Contrary to how it's often presented, the Copernican revolution, where we transitioned from a geocentric to a heliocentric model, wasn't straightforward!  Read <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/JAAHjm4iZ2j5Exfo2/the-copernican-revolution-from-the-inside">The Copernican Revolution From the Inside</a>. In the beginning, the data fit the theory worse!
</p>

<p>
Yet people insisted trying to make heliocentrism true.
</p>

<p>
Why?  They liked its philosophical simplicity.  And in the end, that bore fruit.  That's why we're now so confident in Occam's Razor: when you find a simple theory, it tends to be worth insisting on it for a while, more than any other <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/R6M4vmShiowDn56of/butterfly-ideas">butterfly idea</a>.  If you don't have that policy, you tend to get stuck on theories that fit better <i>right now</i> and miss out on the truth.
</p>

<p>
Science would have discovered almost nothing by now if the scientists weren't thinking about hypotheses according to Occam's Razor.
</p>

<p>
There are infinite possible explanations for any phenomena, and every time you test one and it fails, you can rule out a large segment of the space of possible explanations similar to the one you just tested.  Thus you quickly narrow down the most correct explanations, which results in technology that works.  That phone in your hand was crafted by the invisible hand of Occam.  If you claim that Occam is invalid, then you are claiming that the phone was made by luck.

<title>Losing items in recentf, org-id-locations? Run kill-emacs-hook periodically.</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/rpqbx/losing-items-in-recentf-org-id-locations-run-kill-emacs-hook-periodically" />
<id>urn:uuid:b4c45b70-795e-4631-975d-dbd545272b39</id>
<published>2023-02-03T12:00:00Z</published>
<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
This has been annoying me for years.  Every time I start <a class="pub tag" href="../lpzvv/emacs">#Emacs</a>, there will be some org notes I cannot find by org-id, and recentf suffers partial amnesia so that I cannot jump to a file I was just working on minutes ago (before Emacs crashed), and so on.
</p>

<p>
The issue stems from a programming anti-pattern: assuming that takedown logic will execute.  In other words, relying on <code>kill-emacs-hook</code>.
</p>

<p>
At the end of this page, you can find an initfile snippet to fix this.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Rant:
</p>

<p>
It's insane to put any sort of data-sync on <code>kill-emacs-hook</code>.  Most of the time my Emacs goes down, <b>it happens in a non-clean way</b> &#x2013; why would I intentionally shut off Emacs if everything is fine?  Ergo, that hook never runs.  Package developers, look over your code and ask what happens if <code>kill-emacs-hook</code> never runs.
</p>

<p>
If you want to persist state across restarts, you must write it to disk at some other time than takedown.  Assume your user's customary method of restarting is yanking the power cord &#x2013; code accordingly.
</p>

<p>
IMO they should warn developers about this in the docstring.

<p>
You know situations like when you deadlifted 115 kg last time, and today you come into the gym feeling particularly good, thinking you can shoot for 120 kg to 'leap ahead'?
</p>

<p>
Even if you're sure you can do 120, shoot for 117.5 kg anyway according to plan.
</p>

<p>
The problem with leaping ahead is you rob yourself.  You need to make sure you enjoy every gym-visit, and a part is 'seeing the numbers go up'.  One 5-kg leap creates about as big a burst of satisfaction as two 2.5-kg leaps, and you miss out on the second burst.
</p>

<p>
Not to mention that it often goes like this:  115, 120, &#x2026; 115 again and suddenly you're not having as much fun.  If instead you have patience and go 115, 117.5, 120, &#x2026; then you've also done two separate days above 115 so your body is better prepared for the attempt at 122.5, and in any case you'll backslide less often.

<p>
In the "newbie-gains" period, the numbers easily go up, and that's actually a luxury&#x2014;why rush it?  Milk it for the positive feedback loop as long as it lasts.
</p>

<p>
Plus, hypothetically, if 120 kg is going to be the end of your newbie-gains, then if you spend 2 months on the path from 90 kg to 120 kg, you're much more able to continue beyond, than if you'd only spent 1 month on an accelerated path.
</p>

<p>
On the accelerated path, you ride a strong upward curve and suddenly hit a plateau &#x2013; no fun!  Avoid facing this contrast.  By calming down with the upward curve, you also won't plateau later.
</p>

<p>
When gains are easy, <i>slow down</i>.  Slow down and enjoy.

<p>
I suspect it can be a good strategy to just pay for once-off visits.  For the same money that a membership costs, you can do around 4 once-off visits per month, depending on the gym.
</p>

<p>
Without membership, you're free of all the mental crap associated with "gotta make use of this membership", which may not be a good mindset, compared to going every time because you want to.  And observing yourself pay for the session will crank up your subconscious valuation of the session.

The mental motion of “I didn’t really parse that paragraph, but sure, whatever, I’ll take the author’s word for it” is, in my introspective experience, absolutely identical to “I didn’t really parse that paragraph because it was bot-generated and didn’t make any sense so I couldn’t possibly have parsed it”, except that in the first case, I assume that the error lies with me rather than the text.  This is not a safe assumption in a post-GPT2 world. Instead of “default to humility” (assume that when you don’t understand a passage, the passage is true and you’re just missing something) the ideal mental action in a world full of bots is “default to null” (if you don’t understand a passage, assume you’re in the same epistemic state as if you’d never read it at all.)

<title>Base-62 conversion in Emacs-Lisp</title>

<p>
So while developing my website (which uses Emacs' org-publish), I decided I want base62 permalinks translated from preexisting org IDs.
</p>

<p>
I didn't find any Elisp nor shell utility for base62 encoding, just Javascript and Go libraries.  By luck, I found prior art in the Elisp function <code>org-id-int-to-b36</code>.  Its inverse, <code>org-id-b36-to-int</code>, is already base62-capable, in fact.
</p>

<p>
A quick edit gives us this all-purpose base62 generator:

Did you know <code>string-to-number</code> can parse hexadecimal numbers?  It's so undiscoverable, we should ask upstream to add an alias like "hexa-to-decimal".  Emacs is full of these hidden tools you find under the sofa cushions.

<p>
Say you have the hex string "FFFFFF" (which is the decimal number 16777215).  By first turning it into decimal, you can then turn it into base62.   Evaluating

<pre class="example">
(my-int-to-base62 (string-to-number "FFFFFF" 16))

An arch-bias, supporting many other biases.
</p>

<p>
We all hear about confirmation bias, and maybe we even have a habit of keeping it in mind.  That doesn't mean it's solved, nor that we should focus on other less-known biases as if they were bigger fish to fry.  Paraphrasing Raymond Nickerson 1998: If there were a contest for the single largest problem in human reasoning, confirmation bias would have to be a candidate.  No one is free from it.

<title>Feminism as a practice-case for rationality</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/prlks/feminism-as-a-practice-case-for-rationality" />

<p>
You know how the history of science is littered with cases where progress was held back because so many people couldn't let go of their preconceived notions?  It's why rationalists prize the ability to abandon preconceived notions, and to do so <i>quickly</i>, regardless of how many people stand by the notion currently.  "Speak the truth though your lips may tremble" and all that.
</p>

<p>
Seen through that lens, women's role in history can be another case study of mass-delusion.  Lots of people were unable to see the fact in front of their noses: that women are people.  Even the women themselves didn't see it.  Yet it should be the simplest thing in the world.  Isn't that worrying?
</p>

<p>
If our brains can serve us that badly, how do you know yours isn't keeping up other massive blind spots?
</p>

<p>
The concepts of intersectional feminism are not just things you learn in order to be able to claim you did your part in building a more equal society.
</p>

<p>
They also give you some practice at deconstructing deeply entrenched <a class="pub" href="../hkxpy/aliefs">Aliefs</a>.  Even today, nobody is free of aliefs around gender&#x2026; it's a collective project to catalogue them all, hence that gender studies is a field of research.
</p>

<p>
We can benefit from what they have found so far, like premade lessons.  But the biggest leg of the journey is within yourself, as you digest this material.  You get to observe, almost directly, the shift that happens as various hidden attics in your mind get unhidden, and you realize they were there all along, and it's humbling that, you know, you just <i>didn't see them</i>.
</p>

<p>
Best of all, you get the kind of personal development that makes you feel like a more complete human being.

<p>
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/the-peer-reviewed-saga-of-mindless-eating-mindless-research-is-bad-too/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/the-peer-reviewed-saga-of-mindless-eating-mindless-research-is-bad-too/</a>
</p>

<p>
(Been called Pizzagate, not to be confused with the Trumpist conspiracy theory also known as Pizzagate)
</p>

<p>
Brian Wansink and his apprentices did large scale data dredging, aka p-hacking. Most papers now withdrawn. For fun, read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161216021455/http://www.brianwansink.com/phd-types-only/the-grad-student-who-never-said-no">blog post</a> by Wansink that triggered the scrutiny.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Why did peer review not catch this?
</p>

<p>
“Because peer review doesn’t do this,” Heathers told Ars. The point of peer review has always been for fellow scientists to judge whether a paper is of reasonable quality; reviewers aren't expected to perform an independent analysis of the data.
</p>

<p>
“Historically, we have not asked peer reviewers to check the statistics,” Brown says. “Perhaps if they were [expected to], they’d be asking for the data set more often.” In fact, without open data—something that’s historically been hit-or-miss—it would be impossible for peer reviewers to validate any numbers.
</p>

<p>
Peer review is often taken to be a seal of approval on research, but it’s actually more like a small or large quality boost, depending on the reviewers and scientific journal in question. “In general, it still has a good influence on the quality of the literature,” van der Zee said to Ars. But “it’s a wildly human process, and it is extremely capricious,” Heathers points out.
</p>

<p>
There’s also the question of what’s actually feasible for people. Peer review is unpaid work, Kirschner emphasizes, usually done by researchers on top of their existing heavy workloads, often outside of work hours.
</p>

&gt;”Where are the attempts to disprove the conclusion? Science is about the attempting to DISPROVE a result.”
</p>

<p>
Yep, when I was becoming aware this is one of the first conversations I had in the hallowed academic halls.
</p>

<p>
me: “Shouldn’t we by trying to <b>disprove</b> our hypothesis, rather than prove it? The null hypothesis should be what we predict will happen.”
</p>

<p>
prof: <b>blinks</b> and changes subject

The "himmicanes and hurricanes paper" attempted to show that you can save lives by giving hurricanes male names rather than female names, because a male name is more intimidating so people take more safety measures, while they don't take female hurricanes seriously.
</p>

<p>
It has been refuted by cite:smithHurricaneNamesBunch2016 ; there were quite a few problems with the original paper.

</p>

<p>
One of the misunderstandings of evolution: there's a meme going around that all kinds of things can evolve by natural selection, not just DNA/RNA but also self-copying nanodevices and even things like human corporations.  After all, the market is a battleground where survival of the fittest applies, right?  Presto, evolution!  With time, the corps that survive will be stronger and stronger.
</p>

<p>
Except no.  Many things have to go right for a force like evolution to meaningfully apply.  A big thing missing from corps and nanodevices is copying fidelity.
</p>

<p>
Look.  A corp may be outcompeted by another corp who learns the lesson their enemy failed to learn &#x2013; but that one's successor in turn will easily have never learned this specific lesson, and so be vulnerable to the same mistake.  The same way you carry many of your parents' life-lessons but not so many of your great-grandparents' life-lessons, especially if you've never met them, and so you repeat your great-grandparents' mistakes.  The same way that post-WW2 was a great time for human rights, but a few generations later fascism is on the rise.  Current generations do not have the life-lessons to see through the farce: the life-lessons failed to copy themselves for more than 2-3 generations.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All the old lessons of history, you are doomed to repeat them again and again.
</p>
</blockquote>

&#x2014;Leto II, <i>God Emperor of Dune</i>
</p>

<p>
Contrast with DNA evolution.  Consider a genetic mutation that confers a 3% increase in fitness on average.  DNA copies perfectly, so after about 768 generations(!), every member of the species has inherited it &#x2013; and all copies are exactly identical (if just one molecule sits differently, we regard it a different gene).
</p>

<p>
DNA copies with something like 10<sup>-8</sup> errors per copy, several orders better copying fidelity than we can do with any machine for now &#x2013; I think we're at 10<sup>-2</sup> or something?  Our nanomachines would have something like a million times the mutation rate (i.e. rate of copying errors), which isn't viable for life.

<title>TOML as default, YAML when you know you need it</title>

Takeaways from: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65283208/toml-vs-yaml-vs-strictyaml">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65283208/toml-vs-yaml-vs-strictyaml</a>
</p>

<p>
In summary, YAML isn't actually sloppy <a class="pub tag" href="../gzlqj/tech">#tech</a>, but it's full of features that most people don't use.  For example, you can write a value <code>1d6</code> and have that parsed as an object <code>{number: 1, sides: 6}</code>!
</p>

<p>
When you do have use for stuff like that, you'll know.
</p>

<p>
However&#x2026; most uses of YAML/TOML/JSON files just have a program read in the data in a simplistic way to transform into a table or map object, end of story.  You're not looking for any sophistications.
</p>

<p>
In that case, TOML serves better because fewer possibilities in syntax means it's able to give more specific error messages when the file is misformatted.

<title>Get curious about the Hyperbole prompt</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/nlcjf/get-curious-about-the-hyperbole-prompt" />

<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
Have you seen the Hyperbole prompt (<code>C-h h</code>)?  It's somewhat baroque or at least terse.  I associate the style with "classic" pre-2008 packages such as ido&#x2014;it just takes one line in the minibuffer:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Hy7.1.3&gt;   Act   Butfile/   Cust/   Doc/   Ebut/   Find/   Gbut/   Hist   Ibut/   Kotl/   Msg/   Rolo/   Screen/   Win/
</pre>


<p>
Now there's two ways you could react to seeing this.
</p>

<p>
Panic.  Don't understand.  Quit for now, to pick it up later (probably never).
</p>

<p>
Or&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
Huh.  Lots of concepts I've never seen before!  What could they mean?  What the hell is Ebut?  Ibut?  Rolo?  Someone must've thought they're worth the space they take in this tight prompt &#x2013; let's demystify them one by one!  <code>C-h i d m hyperbole RET</code>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Once in the manual, I suspect us youth zoom past things too much.
</p>

<p>
Look at the introduction.  This software was first copyrighted in 1989!  That predates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2">Fallout 2</a>.  There was no web, not even Netscape Navigator.  Instead, the Berlin Wall stood pristine.  It was closer to the moon landing (1969) than to today.
</p>

<p>
If not all manuals, then at least this manual should be treated like sitting down to watch a good movie.  You know that contentedness when everything is ready, you have your hand in a fresh batch of popcorn, and you're <i>not</i> gonna move from your spot&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;don't just hunt for the info you need to set up the package&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;you don't <i>know</i> what info you need&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;take it slow.  Relax your shoulders.  Enjoy the intro, the license statement, the acknowledgements.  The part about honoring (dead) people who inspired the devs.  The part about dedicating KOutliner to Bob Weiner's wife Kathy.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Perhaps this way of reading a manual is the only way to read an <a class="pub tag" href="../lpzvv/emacs">#Emacs</a> manual, old or new.  You don't need to be here, learning any of this in the first place.  Why not treat it as the leisure it is, and enjoy every step?
</p>

<p>
If you were watching a movie and got stressed, wanted to skip ahead, many people would say you'd better just turn off the movie &#x2013; it isn't doing for you what it's supposed to.  Same situation here.  If you feel the need to skip ahead in a manual, you may as well not have that <code>*info*</code> buffer open at all.  Or even Emacs running.  Or even the laptop open.

<p>
The Royal Society in 1660 had the slogan <i>nullius in verba</i> &#x2013; "Take nobody's word for it".  We can see it as representing a fundamental shift in mindset that we call the Enlightenment.  It used to be near-universal among human cultures to believe in some sort of Fall From Grace: everything was better before, and the most solid knowledge comes from authorities like the church or someone who lived earlier who wrote something, the older the better.  
</p>

<p>
Mapmakers everywhere used to fill-in the regions they didn't know well or didn't know anything about (perhaps they just tried to hide their knowledge-holes in order to sell, but I read in <i>Sapiens: A History of Humankind</i> that it also reflected a different mindset &#x2013; they acted as if knowledge couldn't progress so what we had was as good as we were ever gonna have), but starting around this time, we see maps with blank areas clearly marked as unexplored, which invited curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<b>Admitting what we didn't know</b> led to the desire to find out.
</p>

<p>
But why was truth from established authority no longer satisfactory?
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</i> has an explanation for the post-1600 Europeans' odd (enterprising &amp; exploratory) outlook.
<ul>
<li>Counterexample of the Chinese general who once took fleets as far as Madagascar but whose expeditions ended due to lack of interest from the throne.  This is the norm for most societies.  China didn't believe there was anything of interest far away.  Thus they never discovered Polynesia or Australia.</li>
<li>Science was supported by empires with ample funds.  Every Royal Navy ship brought a scientist or two just because, to document what they found.  From the empire's perspective, it was also a way to buy legitimacy for colonialism, "white man's burden".</li>
<li>Dutch East India Company.  Early stock market.</li>
<li>The tiny Netherlands defeated Spain because investors trusted NL finances.  Spanish king unable to get loans, while NL could get all the loans they wanted.  Early example of the fact that credit-ratin wins wars.</li>

“To say that straight men are heterosexual is only to say that they engage in sex (fucking exclusively with the other sex, i.e., women).  All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men.  The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire…  those are, overwhelmingly, other men.  In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal.  From women they want devotion, service and sex. Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.”

<title>Re-approach the small things in your partner that bother you</title>

<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
These small things may never change, so you shouldn't approach it with an "okay, I'll endure it" mindset.  Better if you learn to view these things thru a different lens, such that they genuinely don't bother you anymore.
</p>

<p>
Or else &#x2013; let them know.  Or what do you think, does it sound like a good idea to keep enduring without ever saying?  It'll explode later during some big conflict and they'll be like "why didn't you tell me earlier?"
</p>

<p>
Note that it doesn't need to be perfectly fixed or perfectly accepted.  It's okay if your partner does little things that bother you, and you do little things that bother them, so long as the other knows it's a bother.  Knowledge disarms it.

A tenet of NVC.  I guess it's a version of the epistemic habit of avoiding premature generalization.

<p>
Instead of "careless husband", just observe that "he left toothpaste in the sink" and nothing more.  By not attributing to fundamental traits (<a class="pub stub" href="../vmqsp/correspondence-bias">Fundamental attribution error</a>), we leave ourselves room to understand their behavior.

Usually when we submit bug reports, we do painstaking detective work first, for good reason.  But I often run across bugs I can't be bothered to track down, and I leave them unfixed for months or years.  Why not publish them too?  Hence this page.  Maybe someone Googles a bug here and gets the chance to talk to me about it.

<p>
Still current as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2023-Jan-25&gt;</span></span>
</p>

<p>
I suspect it has to do with Doom Emacs' <code>javascript</code> module.  Even without <code>+lsp</code>, it starts up tsserver, which is probably a bug in itself.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, starting tsserver used to freeze my Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, with Doom's <code>javascript</code> module, Emacs freezes when opening some files (at least those that contain a @flow comment), or when I try to comment out certain lines of JS.

<p>
An open eshell sometimes seems to mess with <code>org-element–cache-sync</code>.  This interferes with the experience of editing Org buffers.

<p>
Killing the eshell makes org behave normally.

The day women feel just as safe going out at night as men, that's when we might be able to say that feminism is "done".

The day a white person doesn't feel slightly more on-guard when passing a black person (or vice versa) on the street, that's when you'll know racial integration is "done".

<title>Alternatives to beauty-based compliments</title>

<id>urn:uuid:815acc34-ed7b-47ea-815f-b89d778f7fea</id>

<p>
From <a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/06/dont-call-me-beautiful/">https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/06/dont-call-me-beautiful/</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Appearance is often the go-to compliment for women, which should tell you how much gender influences even our most initial judgments and perceptions. In lieu of commenting on the physical, focus your attention on attributes less associated with gender.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a handy list of some examples you can try:
</p>

<p>
<b>“I love your enthusiasm”</b> – this shows the other person that you’re reading their mood and that you’re receptive to positive energy.
</p>

<p>
<b>“You’re looking vivacious today”</b> – again, emphasis on the positive without relying on femininity. Everyone likes being told they’re full of life.
</p>

<p>
<b>“You look confident”</b> – upbeat reinforcement with the added bonus of a self-esteem boost.
</p>

<p>
<b>“I admire the energy you contribute”</b> – because it’s always good to be acknowledged as bringing something to the table of everyday life.
</p>

<p>
<b>“You’re so much fun to be around”</b> – reminding them that their presence matters and is appreciated.
</p>


<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
Let’s face it: <b>Even in its most flattering context, beauty is predictable</b>. Choosing these alternate phrases conveys a more genuine interest in everything the person has to offer.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also: Try to explain how something they did fulfilled one of your needs.  People like hearing that.

<p>
Looking at <a href="https://gwern.net/design">https://gwern.net/design</a>, I realized I have things to say too.
</p>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="orgafb169e"><a href="#orgafb169e">URLs shouldn't be too short</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Look at the link <a href="https://sive.rs/su">https://sive.rs/su</a> &#x2013; what is this monstrosity of a web address?  No contextual information.  If it had been named <code>https://sive.rs/short-urls</code>, I could recognize it as a page I've read before: "ah yeah, that's that page Sivers wrote about short URLs".  With the ultra-short variant, I have to visit it before I can recognize that I've already been there and go back to wherever I was.
<ul>
<li>Sivers would respect my time better if the URL gave enough info for me to <b>avoid</b> clicking it!  There's a design criterion.</li>
<li>Even <a href="https://qntm.org/destroy">https://qntm.org/destroy</a> is not a link I can recognize on sight.  Single-word slugs are usually a bad idea, though <a href="https://gwern.net/design">https://gwern.net/design</a> is OK.  It strains the limits of my pattern-matcher, but it matches.
<ul>
<li>For that particular page, the top domain luckily contributes to the meaning, as the page is literally about the design of gwern.net, not design in general.  In practice, we're looking at a two-word slug.</li>
<li>A year from now, I might not recognize it, but it's night and day compared with <a href="https://qntm.org/destroy">https://qntm.org/destroy</a>, which takes me only an hour to forget.  In the time I've been drafting this article I've been largely unaware of just what article that links to &#x2013; I visit a few times for curiosity, but the association between the generic verb "destroy" and <i>that article</i> fades so quickly.  "Qntm destroy what?"</li>
<li>The ideal slug is seen in URLs like <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/x4dG4GhpZH2hgz59x/joy-in-the-merely-real">https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/x4dG4GhpZH2hgz59x/joy-in-the-merely-real</a>, if we ignore for a moment the superfluous bits and bobs like the <code>/posts/x4dG4GhpZH2hgz59x/</code> and the <code>www</code>.  I prefer to handle links such as this.  It's many years ago I visited this link, yet even after all that time, it's impossible to mistake.  That feature, recognizability, trumps any length aesthetic.
<ul>
<li>To sum up, slugs should be long and specific to be maximally recognizable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should have to click links as little as possible (my site is a rat's nest of hyperlinks only as far as it must be).  The same theory underlies people like Gwern's efforts to contextualize links and generate preview pop-ups.  I say, it helps a lot just having a descriptive URL in the first place.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="vqdry"><a class="pub" href="#vqdry">Permanent page ID</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>My URLs get a unique random ID before the descriptive slug, i.e. <code>domain.com/id/slug</code>, giving me full freedom to rename the <code>slug</code> part and split and merge pages.  I couldn't live without that; almost all my pages have been renamed at least once, and some have been through a dozen renames.

<ul>
<li>My page ID is five alphabetic characters, sans vowels, all lowercase.
<ul>
<li>This implies a 21-character alphabet, or "base-21".  Out of that alphabet, there are 4,084,101 ways to compose a five-char string, plenty for one person's homepage (<a class="pub" href="../gvvpq/how-large-ids">How long page-IDs?</a>).
<ul>
<li>The probability of collision is low but not effectively zero like with a proper UUID, but that's the advantage of a one-person one-machine system &#x2013; when a collision occurs, I can just renew the ID.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Excluding vowels prevents accidentally generating words (and obscenities).  It means I can have custom routes such as <code>domain.com/login</code> without worrying that there already exists an autogenerated ID "login".</li>
<li><p>
<b>Old mistake:</b> Instead of alphabetic, it used to be base-62 i.e. the ID could include numbers and capital letters.  I had links like <code>edstrom.dev/m99K</code> and <code>edstrom.dev/0dSJ</code>.
</p>

<p>
Use lowercase alphabetic!  It nod to the fact that <a class="pub" href="../kdbws/urls-are-an-user-interface">URLs are a user interface</a>!
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I want to send myself a link between devices, but I have to stop and think how to do that.  (Do I email myself?  Do I use the Share button?)  If the URL is short, it's almost always faster and more comfortable to just type it.  Right?
</p>

<p>
Here base-62 comes into the picture and tramples my lawn, because phone keyboards&#x2014;

<h2 id="orga8afb8d"><a href="#orga8afb8d">What distinguishes a pizzabox?</a></h2>

<p>
I decided long ago on a 92mm CPU fan, not a 120mm beast straddling the whole motherboard blocking DIMM and M.2 slots and giving the case the experience of a cramped cupboard.  I don't like "efficient" when it leads to that.  A stationary computer is partly an art piece for me, I want to feel <b>peace and harmony</b> when I look into it!
</p>

<p>
That's the upside of the classic ATX miditower: the experience of roominess and easy access, and I've seen 1990s pizzaboxes that created the same experience.  To do so, the case should leave about 5 centimeters of margin around every component (and between the component and outer panels), allowing cables to go around the components as if they were roads around buildings.
</p>

<p>
The best modern example I've seen is the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hdplex+h5&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">HDPLEX H5</a>, but there's surely room for improvement.  It holds no candle to the unidentified 90s cases I've seen&#x2014;I wish I could link to those.
</p>

<p>
In my mind, "pizzabox" refers to those 90s cases that <b>didn't try to be small-form-factor, just thin</b>.  They emphasised <b>easy access</b>.  You didn't have the typical trouble with modern SFF (small-form-factor) PCs where you must try to get your hands in under other components to make adjustments in nooks and crannies, nor did you have to remove other components to get them out of the way &#x2014; you could access any one component in isolation and swap it out in isolation!  That's my pizza-box dream.
</p>

<p>
For another distinguishing trait, you know those roof brackets, whatever they're called, that run across the middle of many modern slimline chassis to help with sturdiness?  The thinner the case, the sillier this looks.  In a 1990s pizzabox, you didn't have that &#x2013; you just had full-blown <b>walls</b>, i.e. the pizzabox could be divided into 2-5 separate compartments.  They could do this because they didn't put so much of a premium on low volume per se, just thinness.
</p>

<p>
I'm biased, but I think here's an unexploited market segment.  That's particularly true for 1U-thin cases, because there are at least three tricks that become obvious once you permit yourself to be generous with the X and Y dimensions, but I've never seen them in the wild:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Water cooling:  1U gives just enough headroom (44mm) for a radiator plus slim fans.
<ul>
<li>(And it'd easily look fantastic)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The FlexATX PSU can be quiet if you cool it with a slim 80-120mm fan <i>in front of</i> the PSU &#x2013; you simply remove the builtin 40mm fan and perforate extra air grilles in the PSU enclosure.</li>
<li>Even if you don't watercool, It would be easy in a 44mm headroom to perfectly plan the airflow and thus force regular chassis airflow right through the CPU and GPU heatsinks on its way out. (As an illustrative example, you could file down an <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/arctic-alpine-am4-passive-heatsink,37103.html">Artic Passive AM4</a> heatsink to fit.)  Thus, you don't need any fans hugging the heatsink diretly, the fans can be elsewhere in the chassis, and as a consequence the chassis can permit heatsinks of reasonable mass.
<ul>
<li>Imagine a three-compartment pizzabox: along one edge sits three 120mm+ slim fans&#x2026; one for the PSU compartment, one for the entire CPU compartment, one for the GPU compartment.</li>
<li>As an aside, it seems to me the small-form-factor market would be interested if someone made a mini-ITX motherboard with a boxed CPU heatsink that perfectly fits the motherboard in question, using all the free volume over its 170x170mm area (and for non-pizzaboxes, inviting an 170mm fan on top of it all)!</li>

<p>
We speak of "hearing" our internal voices, and scientists have seen activity in the brain's auditory cortex when we do.  Apparently we've also been able to reconstruct images from a cat's visual cortex, seeing what it sees.
</p>

<p>
One day, we'll likely be able to read back someone's internal monologue.
</p>

<p>
That's useful to know in the p-zombie thought experiment, which tries to eliminate dualism without eliminating it.  It's the idea that you could have a world where all the people behave exactly like people in our world, but nobody is home in their heads to experience things &#x2013; no "soul" so to speak.  Philosophical zombies.  Pretty much what <a class="pub person" href="../vgqps/rene-descartes">René Descartes (1596&#x2013;1650)</a> thought of non-human animals, but extended to claim that the very fact that people go around talking about feelings still isn't proof that they experience any.
</p>

<p>
But in this purely "mechanical" world where nobody's actually experiencing anything&#x2014;where there's nobody we would think of as alive&#x2014;why would the p-zombie have an internal voice, and talk to other p-zombies about how they experience their internal voice?
</p>

<p>
Dissolving the thought experiment gets very deep, so I'm stopping here.
</p>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="orgb7cb4b2"><a href="#orgb7cb4b2">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If you skimmed the above summary, you might get the idea that the conclusion would run along the lines that there must be "a ghost in the machine", that-which-experiences, a soul, but the conclusion is the opposite!  We can see the experiences in the lab: the auditory cortex, made of material cells, very much part of this world, does some work which <i>is</i> the sensation of an internal voice.
</p>

<p>
In other words, the p-zombie is an impossible postulate because the material world is sufficient to create experiences.  If the material world is sufficient to create experiences, there's nothing left for a soul to <i>do</i>.  What's it there for?
</p>

<p>
It's rather the belief in souls (dualism) that requires also claiming that p-zombies are possible, so that the soul can be said to add something.

Most online material about fast handwriting directs you to learn a so-called shorthand system, like Gregg or Pitman.  I don't want to do that, so here are some other tricks to speed up writing.
</p>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="org5455880"><a href="#org5455880">Mix cursive and print styles</a></h2>

<p>
Some research showed that the fastest writers do this, instead of sticking only with cursive or only with print.
</p>

<p>
I believe your basic approach would be <i>cursive-first</i>, and just changing some letters for the print version.  I'm guessing the following print letters tend to be faster:
</p>
<ul>
<li>b, h, k, l, q</li>
</ul>

<p>
It also probably depends on what letter came before, so it's a bit of an art.
</p>

</section>
<section class="even">
<h2 id="orgfb5773b"><a href="#orgfb5773b">Simplify your print-letters</a></h2>

<p>
Omit the initial stroke on these letters: m, n, r, u
</p>

<p>
Draw these in a single stroke instead of two strokes: d, g, p, q
</p>

<p>
Draw s as a backwards c.
</p>

<p>
Omit the step where you "cross the T's and dot the I's".  It looks weird but you get used to it.  Letters affected: f, i, j, t
</p>

<p>
Do all the above, and I expect you'll need no cursive at all.

<p>
It can be either an <b>acronym</b> you make on the spot, like if you're writing about the Second Law of Thermodynamics then the acronym "SLOT" will be clear from the context, or it can be a <b>clipped word</b> like "ind." for "independence".
</p>

<p>
Trust in your future-self to make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
If you're worried your future-self won't make sense of a particular abbrev, I guess you can add a legend for that one in the margins, afterward.  But I'll bet usually as long as you make it obvious this is an abbreviation (clipped words should always have a dot at the end), that's enough to cue future-you into searching the context for meaning.

I still live somewhat in the world where people used to type things in the address bar.  I like seeing urls containing e.g. <code>/news/america/</code>, inferring the logic, then manually setting it to <code>/news/europe/</code>.  If that URL exists, this method is much faster than to spend up to a minute navigating their website, and it is <i>so</i> relaxing &#x2013; zero frustration incurred!  Zero eyeball time on ads.  Sometimes, a website can offer no better interface than predictable URLs.

Sometimes I want to send myself a link between devices, but I have to stop and think how to do that.  (Do I email myself?  Will the Share button even allow&#x2014;ugh.)  If the URL is short, I can just type it and let my logistics subagent keep napping.

</p>

<p>
A popular idea of "rationality" is Spock from Star Trek.  Yet Spock is much more like a sub-par human statistician than a rational being, if you follow <a class="pub" href="../gtbgj/cognitive-science">Cognitive science</a>'s definition of rationality.  He's merely the autist of the TV-show, and if anyone is the rationalist, it's Captain Kirk.  Why?  Because he makes the right decision often, the decision that saves the Enterprise.
</p>

<p>
The Hollywood-Rationalist Spock says something like: "our probability of survival if we go into that nebula is 0.0023%".  Then Kirk says to go into it anyway, and nine episodes out of ten, the Enterprise is fine!
</p>

<p>
Kirk doesn't survive due to or despite irrationality; on the contrary, because he survives, his choice must've been the rational one.  Rationality is just about winning.  It's making the decision that saves the Enterprise; it's making the most right decision with the greatest chance of success, whatever you mean by "right", and even if you don't have an exact idea of the numbers involved.  It's not about ignoring your emotions and ignoring what your "gut" tells you in favour of a deliberate probability or utility calculation, though it can be.  If your gut has been reliable in the past in similar situations, it's rational to trust in it and irrational to ignore it.
</p>

<p>
Yudkowsky talks about emotions being rational:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For my part, I label an emotion as "not rational" if it rests on mistaken beliefs, or rather, on mistake-producing epistemic conduct: "If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is hot, and it is cool, the Way opposes your fear.  If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is cool, and it is hot, the Way opposes your calm."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All curiosity is not equal:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But what set humanity firmly on the path to Science was noticing that certain modes of thinking uncovered beliefs that let us <i>manipulate the world</i>.  As far as sheer curiosity goes, spinning campfire tales of gods and heroes satisfied that desire just as well, and no one realized that anything was wrong with that.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;
For this reason, I would also label as "morality" the belief that truthseeking is pragmatically important to society, and therefore is incumbent as a duty upon all.

<p>
EY says this is a special case of <a class="pub" href="../bbmxj/conservation-of-expected-evidence">Conservation of Expected Evidence</a>.
</p>

<p>
There is a possibly surprising contrast with logic.  Logic is the basis of the sentence we've all heard: "absence of proof is not proof of absence".
</p>

<p>
(It's logically true that <span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mtext>  </mtext><mo>⟹</mo><mtext>  </mtext><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A \implies B</annotation></semantics></math></span>
 doesn't imply that <span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A̸</mi><mtext>  </mtext><mo>⟹</mo><mtext>  </mtext><mi>B̸</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\not A \implies \not B</annotation></semantics></math></span>
, i.e. if A implies B, it doesn't mean a lack of A implies a lack of B.)
</p>

<p>
No, it can't be proof, but it <i>is</i> still evidence in that direction.
</p>

<p>
In terms of probability theory, if observing A increases your confidence in B, then not observing it must decrease the confidence.
</p>

<p>
To spell it out in an equation, we have three quantities:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Pr(B)
Pr(B | A)
Pr(B | ~A)
</pre>


<p>
Now we make the following claim.
</p>

<pre class="example">
     Pr(B | A} &gt; Pr(B}
==&gt; Pr(B | ~A) &lt; Pr(B)
</pre>


<p>
You can see why "absence of proof is not proof of absence": yes, the probability drops, but it doesn't drop all the way to zero (that'd be absurd anyway).  Absence of proof is still evidence of absence.
</p>

<p>
How much the probability drop?  That's a function of on how much the opposite outcome would have raised it.

Hands are made of thumb, fingers, palm!  There is no hand!
</p>

<p>
Well, of course there are hands.  Hands are a simplification inside our heads (in the map, not in the territory), and it's useful to speak of hands even if there's no singular irreducible entity in reality that maps to what we mean by that word.
</p>

<p>
Airplanes are made of fuselage and wings.  Wings are made of atoms, atoms are made of quarks etc.  All these levels are mental simplifications.  There is no observable in reality that would distinguish one object as an airplane and another as a collection of atoms configured as what we'd call an airplane.  If you were using words imprecisely, you might say that they're the same thing.  But more precisely, reality contains <i>only</i> the latter, but in our mind we represent it <i>only</i> as the former because that's simpler to work with.  Reality is a sea of quarks and we see patterns in that sea, but that doesn't mean the patterns exist as irreducible wholes.
</p>

<p>
A hands is just a thumb, fingers and palm.  There is no hand.
</p>

<p>
Once you've separated mental buckets for these ideas, that sentence shouldn't feel confusing or paradoxical.  You can truthfully say there is a hand &#x2013; if you mean that there is one in our mental reality.  There isn't even thumb or fingers or palm either.
</p>

<p>
Reductionism is the refusal to project our mental maps out into the territory, so we don't insist the scribble in our map is a Thing out there.

<ul>
<li>Systema naturae</li>
<li>Complete, consistent and hierarchic classification</li>
<li>Reactions in Paris</li>
<li>Can systematizing be scientific?
<ul>
<li>Yes, if open for revisions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Three kingdoms: Rocks, plants, animals. Classify every object that exists, not just life. Stuff not to be in two kingdoms at once.
</p>

<p>
Never visited tropical areas. Did not know how rich biodiversity was.
</p>

<p>
Reactions mixed. Old-school to want to "put everything in boxes". Others adulated him.
</p>

<p>
Is systematizing really good science? Sure, if it's open for revisions, because you can learn about little-known members by inferring from the class they belong to. Also he revised his own work multiple times.
</p>

<p>
Whale? He never saw one. But it was found they belonged better in mammals, so Linnaeus moved them there.

<title>If you demand magic, magic won't help</title>

If you need to live in a world with magic to take your life somewhere great and fulfil your dreams &#x2013; 'if only magic were real' &#x2013; you may be engaging in a fantasy that's comfortably out of reach so you need not even try.  Realize that being in a world with magic would make it no longer special, the same way you treat lightbulbs as nothing special in this world.  Thus, if you weren't studying difficult topics here, you wouldn't be studying magic there, as it'd be just another difficult topic that nobody regards as interesting.  "What do you study?" "Magic." "Cool. I study art." "Bachelor's degree or&#x2026;?"
</p>

<p>
Thus: if you're the sort of person to demand a magical world, actually living in that magical world wouldn't change anything, so what's the point?

<title>How long page-IDs?</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/gvvpq/how-large-ids" />

<published>2024-02-19T12:00:00Z</published>
<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
Should I have four characters or five, for the page IDs on this homepage?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Four is a namespace of 194,000 permutations</li>
<li>Five is a namespace of 4,000,000 permutations</li>
</ul>

<p>
I <i>could</i> have had four characters.  I tried it for a while, but as soon as I was going to post a link to a big website, my stomach turned.  What if I'll have to migrate to five in the future?
</p>

<p>
See, with four, I had only had about 12 collisions for my first 3,000 IDs.   That's fine, it's no effort to renew so few duplicates.  But the more IDs you generate, the more often you will get duplicates, as you exhaust the namespace.
</p>

<p>
We software people know the value of overprovisioning a namespace.  Many lessons from IPv4 and such fiascos.  It's hard to predict how much you will need.
</p>

<p>
My rate of ID generation by <a class="private daily" href="../wsxql/2024-02-19">&lt;2024-Feb-19&gt;</a> was such that I expected to make no more than 20,000 IDs over my lifetime, but what if I decide to assign an ID to every subheading inside every page?  Then it'd jump to perhaps 60,000.  At that point, every third new ID will be a duplicate.  And what if I decide something else crazy?
</p>

<p>
So.. five it is.

<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
Steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In the menu, go to Notes &gt; Manage Note Types</li>
<li>Select the note type you'll edit; here I picked my Cloze type</li>
<li>Click on "Cards"</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now you should see the template editor.
</p>

<p>
Add <code>{{Tags}}</code> to the <b>Front Template</b> tab:
</p>

<pre class="src src-html"><span style="color: #f2fffc; background-color: #273136;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #baa0f8;">div</span> <span style="color: #ff6d7e; font-weight: bold;">class</span>="<span style="color: #ffed72;">tags</span>"<span style="color: #f2fffc; background-color: #273136;">&gt;</span>{{Tags}}<span style="color: #f2fffc; background-color: #273136;">&lt;/</span><span style="color: #baa0f8;">div</span><span style="color: #f2fffc; background-color: #273136;">&gt;</span>
{{cloze:Text}}
</pre>


<p>
Should look like that:
<img src="/attachments/invertable.20230922_15h20m47s_grim.png" alt="invertable.20230922_15h20m47s_grim.png" />
</p>


<p>
Now switch to the <b>Styling</b> tab and style the tags:
</p>


<pre class="src src-css"><span style="color: #7cd5f1;">.tags</span> {
    <span style="color: #f2fffc;">font-size</span>: <span style="color: #baa0f8;">14</span><span style="color: #7cd5f1;">px</span>;
    <span style="color: #f2fffc;">color</span>: <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #808080;">grey</span>;
    <span style="color: #f2fffc;">text-align</span>: <span style="color: #7cd5f1;">right</span>;
}
</pre>


<p>
Should look like that:
<img src="/attachments/invertable.20230922_15h27m07s_grim.png" alt="invertable.20230922_15h27m07s_grim.png" />

</p>

<p>
The basic thrust: many of the systems and institutions that are absolutely necessary for human society to function are currently absent.  It is unsurprising when society doesn't seem capable to do things that are good for it &#x2013; that's what we would expect, if we were an alien visitor hearing of how humans have structured their society, taking human psychology into account.  You could say it's "broken", but that word implies there was once an initial state when it did work &#x2013; there never was.  It's hard for a collection of humans to bootstrap a functional society, it'll get stuck in all sorts of traps, "local maxima", but at least we can start identifying these traps.

<title>Follow blogs by people deep in each field, not news</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/ghhpy/follow-blogs-by-people-deep-in-each-field-not-news" />
<id>urn:uuid:4f5610f9-24fb-4b77-aaec-ec4a7d6d70da</id>
<published>2023-01-05T12:00:00Z</published>
<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
What's a better way of staying up to date, than following news?
</p>

<p>
Follow blogs by the sort of people who like to try to explain to laymen.  For example, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu">Andrew Gelman</a>'s blog for topics surrounding statistics.
</p>

<p>
Following news sucks because
</p>
<ul>
<li>The selection of news you see today is a nonrepresentative selection of what happened today, muddling the waters for your <a class="pub" href="../fddkv/availability-heuristic">Availability heuristic</a> and inner simulator.</li>
<li>The selection of news you see today is what I might call counterfactually-arbitrary&#x2026;  I mean that from your perspective, a given day looks perfectly <i>compatible with</i> many different possible sets of news articles, without changing which world you live in.  The information has low value because you don't have any idea of the process underlying why <i>this</i> ended up in the news  and not other stuff, even if you trusted the editor.</li>
<li><p>
For academic topics, reliably they're just plain wrong (see Gell-Mann amnesia)!  Perhaps it'd be worth reading if the news is actually good, but you can't judge this for yourself in most domains.
</p>

<p>
From <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/gell-mann-amnesia/">Gell-Mann Amnesia</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you or your company has EVER been the primary subject of a newspaper article, you know exactly what Crichton is talking about. The article is simply wrong. Not just wrong in minor detail, but wrong in motivation, cause, implication, fundamental facts … everything. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>
Also you need to read <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/rvpEF2mBLeZE9j53n/how-to-bounded-distrust">https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/rvpEF2mBLeZE9j53n/how-to-bounded-distrust</a>.
</p>

<p>
A trick may be to follow content-producers that don't put the idea of news itself as their product.  Direct news made sense in the era of newspapers, it doesn't in the internet era.  By its very nature, news will find its way to you in the course of your normal interactions with people and what they've written.
</p>

<p>
In fact, waiting for them this way ensures relevance to you, and it's more likely you hear it when you're working on something associated and thus you may be in a better position to act in response to the news.
</p>

<p>
I suspect there's one field for which you'll still want to explicitly follow news: geopolitics.  Or new laws.  You don't hear about all of it from your friends, and sometimes it's relevant sooner than later.
</p>
<section class="odd">
<h3 id="org1874e2c"><a href="#org1874e2c">Track-record</a></h3>

<p>
Speaking of news organizations, it struck me that I never hear about people keeping track of how each one reported things in the past and how closely they turned out to reflect reality, with hindsight.
</p>

<p>
As an alien visiting Earth, I'd have expected that sort of practice to be widespread, necessary for keeping the organizations honest.

<h2 id="vtvgz"><a class="pub" href="#vtvgz">Why care about quantum physics?</a></h2>

<p>
EY had many reasons to write about quantum physics, including (emphases mine):
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>“the many-worlds issue is just about the only case I know of where you can <b>bring the principles of Science and Bayesianism into direct conflict</b>.” It’s important to have different mental buckets for “science” and “rationality”, as they are different concepts. Bringing the two principles into direct conflict is helpful for illustrating what science is and is not, and what rationality is and is not. Otherwise you end up trusting in what you call “science”, which won’t be strict enough. [&#x2026;]</li>

<li>“part of what goes into becoming a rationalist, is <b>learning to live into a counterintuitive world</b> — learning to find things underneath the surface that are unlike the world of surface forms.” Quantum mechanics makes a good introduction to that, when done correctly without the horrible confusion and despair. It breaks you of your belief in an intuitive universe, counters naive realism, destroys your trust in the way that your cognitive algorithms look from inside—and <b>then you’re ready to start seeing your mind as a mind,  not as a window onto reality</b>. [&#x2026;]</li>

<li>"But there were <b>physicists talking complete nonsense about Occam’s Razor</b> without knowing the probability theory of it, so my hand was forced" [&#x2026;]</li>

<li><b>“knowing about many worlds, helps you visualize probabilities as frequencies</b>, which is helpful to many points I want to make.” [&#x2026;]</li>

<li>“reducing time to non-time is a powerful <b>example</b> of the principle, in reductionism, that you should reduce something to something other than itself.” [&#x2026;]</li>

<li>“transhumanist mailing lists have been arguing about <b>issues of personal identity</b> for years, and a tremendous amount of time has been wasted on it.” Probably most who argue, will not bother to read what I have set forth; but if it stops any intelligent folk from wasting further time, that too is a benefit. [&#x2026;]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
In summary,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Case study of where science as a social toolkit breaks down, and you need to seriously understand Occam's Razor</li>
<li>Learning to live in a counterintuitive world</li>
<li>Using many-worlds to help you visualize probabilities as frequencies (although I suppose you don't need to accept MWI to use it as a metaphor)</li>
<li>Issues of personal identity / continuity of consciousness</li>
</ol>

<p>
seems to me there is also something it could say with <a class="pub" href="../ndfng/book-anthropic-bias">anthropic reasoning</a> involved, about your location in the multiverse?

OK, some rels. need time to grow, but if there's a part of yourself you're holding off on revealing, that sort of thing should have a known stop-condition.
</p>

<p>
"Shadow-work": sunlighting the parts of yourself you're afraid of.  It's also self-work, but it is not only for your sake, but so you can <b>bring the real you to the relationship!</b>
</p>

<p>
Tip: If too hard to be open, tell a therapist first.   Also even if you don't endorse your own feelings, <a class="pub stub" href="../wtpmk/you-can-still-talk-about-feelings-you-dont-endorse">You can still talk about feelings you don't endorse</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>
"Secondly, showing up means consciously working to gain control of your emotions.  This means clearing your unconscious.  It’s called shadow work.  It’s long, painful, and messy.  Those shadows are slippery and elusive.  Yet, if you commit to showing up, you will flush them out one by one. 
</p>

<p>
As you do, you will have a slowly dawning sense of what emotional responsibility is.  It’s the ability to be fully present with your emotions, no matter what they are.
</p>

<p>
Only when you’re able to be fully present with your emotions are you able to be fully present with yourself.  This is the great gift of emotional responsibility—the full presence of your own being in your own life.

<title>Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794)</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/fcwmd/antoine-lavoisier-1743-1794" />

<published>2023-05-06T12:00:00Z</published>
<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
At the time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There was no cell theory of biology</li>
<li>Nobody knew about DNA</li>
<li>Nobody knew about thermodynamics, that "matter can't be created or destroyed".  If you focus the Sun on a goop of antimony, it'd billow a thick white smoke for a while, and then weigh 10% <i>more</i> than before, and people thought why not?  They saw no reason the sun couldn't add weight to some things.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was a time when you'd look at your hands, flex them, and have absolutely no idea what moves them, <i>why</i> they move, while clay molded into the shape of hands just sits there.
</p>

<p>
Lavoisier discovered fire, i.e. combustion, and that we organisms also do some form of combustion, because like a fire, we consume "vital air" (oxygen) and replace some of it with "fixed air" (carbon dioxide), and the more so when we do physically demanding work.  Here was why we need oxygen just as badly as a fire does: we operate by the same process!  Amazing!
</p>

<p>
He discovered that if you weigh not only the thing being burned but also the gases in the room, the total weight of both stays the same before and after a fire.  Burning wood releases the wood's matter into the air, while burning antimony sucks some matter out of the air, hence why the burnt antimony weighs more.

<h2 id="vqytl"><a class="pub" href="#vqytl">Reality is laced together</a></h2>

<p>
In the book <i>The Incomplete Enchanter</i>, the hero is transported to a magical world based on Norse myth, where technology doesn't work, so naturally when the hero tries to strike a match, it fails to catch aflame.
</p>

<p>
But if you were transported into such a system of physics, you would die&#x2026; because your cells live on combustion too.
</p>

<p>
This is an example of why you usually can't retcon any part of our physics, because you end up with an universe that can't support life.  All the physics laws tie into each other; reality is laced together a lot more tightly than people realize.

<p>
Life retains order: when entropy increases e.g. a room gets more chaotic, you clean up, put stuff in their proper place. Everything you do, such as standing straight, is an instance of reversing entropy.
</p>

<p>
When you die, you no longer reverse entropy. Come back to your corpse in three weeks and it smells: entropy has done its work, which was blocked while you were alive.

<p>
Woah, I had multiple epiphanies about <a href="https://github.com/meedstrom/inline-anki">inline-anki</a>, as I thought about making a <code>#+begin_anki</code> structure type that can take parameters, a very "idiomatic" solution for Org-mode.  But it felt clunky, and I wanted to go the other direction and not even have drawer boundaries.
</p>

<p>
First, an elegant syntax for multiline flashcards is the SINGLE-COLUMN TABLE.  No more excess lines!
</p>

<pre class="example">
| Front   |
| Back    |
</pre>


<ul>
<li>If it has exactly 2 rows, it's a front-back note</li>
<li>If it has 3 or more rows, it's a cloze note, and each row is taken as a new paragraph.</li>
<li>Think about it, how often do you create a single-column table otherwise?  Never!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Second, what if I <b>eliminate the note ID</b> and just use heuristic recognition?  It's crazy, but bear with me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
We'd fetch the Anki database over AnkiConnect, and a given Org paragraph would just be diffed with the entire collection until we find a match with 75%+ similarity.  Then we say "ok, that's the same note".  Otherwise we create a new note.  So if you radically change a paragraph, it'd become an all-new flashcard, and I think I'm OK with that.
</p>

<p>
And old flashcards are very easy to find in the Anki database browser thanks to datestamped tags, so we can choose whether to toss the ones we we've "deprecated" in this fashion, since we know there exists a replacement.
</p>

<p>
Third, what if I add <code>|</code> or some such glyph to org-emphasis-alist (yes, <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12814/extending-org-mode-with-more-markups">doable</a>)?  Then we need no magic string to mark anything as a flashcard.  We'd be able to control whether this should look like bold or italic or something else (I suggest 'box') or nothing at all, and the markers even become invisible with <code>org-hide-emphasis-markers</code>.
</p>

<p>
The end result of all this&#x2026; we can call "invisible-anki".

<content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
Inferential distance wasn't a problem in the EEA.  At most, what you had to stay was one inferential step removed from public knowledge:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When you discover a new oasis, you don't have to explain to your fellow tribe-members what an oasis is, or why it's a good idea to drink water, or how to walk.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One reason why we fall for the illusion of transparency / the curse of expertise.

<h3 id="orgc3881f0"><a href="#orgc3881f0">Discussion: Other ways to speed up</a></h3>

<p>
From first principles, it is a bit silly to need caching to speed org-roam to an acceptable level.  Why is it so slow?  The problem is fundamentally that <code>(org-roam-node-read–completions)</code> takes ages to return, and it just returns the whole DB, in unoptimized form.
</p>

<p>
To see how fast a more efficient table would make it, see vulpea.el.  It's about 5x faster for me.
</p>

<p>
But to make it <i>instant</i>, we could make async replacements for the commands <code>org-roam-node-find</code> etc (or more likely <code>vulpea-find</code> etc) based on <code>consult–read</code>.
</p>

<p>
That <code>consult–read</code> can take as parameter either a table directly (in which case it's synchronous), or it can take a function to query for results.  I believe this function would need to wrap a <code>while-no-input</code> form that incrementally builds a list by popping the DB/table one row at a time.

<p>
Before you can start to use roam refs confidently, or even really understand what they are, you need a picture in your head of how they will make your life easier.
</p>

<p>
Part of my picture was that I should be able to insert a raw URL anywhere and then if I click on it, Emacs will jump to the corresponding roam-node if I happen to have one that refs that URL.
</p>

<p>
This replacement for <code>org-open-at-point</code> does that.

<p>
I encourage you to maintain a personal variant of <code>org-roam-extract-subtree</code>.  It's a pleasure to have one that does everything right.
</p>

<p>
Here's mine.  Compare with the original (use <code>M-x find-function</code>).  Differences from the default command:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Actually make a file-level node, i.e. a file with <code>:PROPERTIES:</code> at the top, instead of a plain file with a top-level heading</li>
<li>Skip prompting for a title &#x2013; just reuse the heading as title</li>
<li>Copy the original file's <code>:CREATED:</code> property if the subtree didn't already have its own (I use this property everywhere because it's not as if you can rely on filesystem ctime)</li>
<li>Copy all the parent tags
<ul>
<li>Only if <code>org-use-tag-inheritance</code> is t</li>
<li>If there were no tags anywhere, add a <code>:noexport:</code> tag.  That's normally what I want for new nodes (<a class="pub" href="../zvjjm/slipbox-workflow">Slipbox workflow</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add a <code>#+date:</code> for me to fill in later
<ul>
<li>I use this field to indicate the date of "<a href="https://gwern.net/about#fn32">last meaningful update</a>", thus it becomes Last Updated on my blog.  Could use file modification time, but it is not meaningful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show the resulting file to me, so I can verify it looks right</li>
<li>Leave a link in the original file, where the subtree was</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="org891e36d"><a href="#org891e36d">Auto-rename file based on #+title</a></h2>

<p>
In Org-roam, nodes are named by the <code>#+title</code> line &#x2013; it doesn't care about the name of the files on the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
However, the filename does influence the exported HTML filenames, which determines your blog post addresses.
</p>

<p>
With the following command, you can type <code>M-x my-rename-roam-file-by-title</code> whenever you want to update the filename.

<title>"Is that Linux?"</title>

<p>
When some people see my computer screen, they ask me what OS I'm running, or "Is that Linux?".  I find it hard to answer that question well, because any short answer won't explain what they're seeing.
</p>

<p>
To answer, I should unpack:
</p>
<ul>
<li>that the concepts of taskbar, system tray, notifications, file explorer, window manager, even hotkey daemon and desktop wallpaper, are not tied to OS, but all separate programs</li>
<li>that many Linux distributions can look identical; they differ in the nerdy details but rarely the visual &#x2013; and that's not to say they all look the same way, but there are a thousand ways any of them can look, so nothing is determined by which Linux distribution you've got</li>
<li>to me, the most salient part of what I've got on screen tends to be Emacs, but again, its appearance isn't unique among text editors &#x2013; it's just text on a background, and I can color the text and the background any way I like
<ul>
<li>there may also be eye-candy &#x2013; that's not Emacs, that's just some other programs I've got</li>

<p>
I was reading a Reddit thread about how it's supposedly so difficult to learn coding with ADHD.  (I can't find it now.)
</p>

<p>
I find coding an ideal activity &#x2013; constant stimulation, nonlinear problem-solving, and it suits an incremental work style like when you distract yourself from a sub-problem in favour of another.  But I recognize that it's demotivating when you start out and don't know anything.
</p>

<p>
It's fun once you have most of the fundamental computer concepts in hand, but how do you get there?
</p>

<p>
My story was incremental and accidental.  I never decided "OK I'm going to learn programming" and sat down with a textbook.  That wouldn't have worked.
</p>

<p>
My story was more a transition from simply being a "power user" to deploying more and more advanced solutions to fix problems or get things done on my computer.
</p>

<p>
Things like installing mods for video games.  Writing direct HTML for a profile page on one of the pre-Facebook social media.  Mass-renaming a folder of songs to satisfy my perfectionism.
</p>

<p>
A big shift came with installing Debian GNU+Linux on a MacBook.  The process of setting it up had a lot of unexpected roadblocks.  Even more so for ricing it (customizing it the way I liked it).  Luckily I didn't know that ahead of time.  It was just one problem or one minor irritation at a time.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, I picked up shell scripting, regular expressions, Git, <a class="pub tag" href="../lpzvv/emacs">#Emacs</a>&#x2026;  The rest is history.

<title>cl-loop beats map-keymap</title>
<link href="https://edstrom.dev/bvsch/cl-loop-beats-map-keymap" />

<p>
Did you ever need to make many lookups or changes in <a class="pub tag" href="../lpzvv/emacs">#emacs</a> key bindings, but balked at the complexity of programming with <code>map-keymap</code>?
</p>

<p>
Me too.  Good news, you can skip that mess!  There's a keyword in <code>cl-loop</code> that is much more intuitive, and it's still blisteringly fast.  It's been around since 1993, but I've found no blog posts about it.
</p>

<p>
There's a gotcha I want to tell you about, I'll get to that in a moment.
</p>

<p>
First, typical usage goes like this example:
</p>

<p>
(Behold!  Lisp gone ugly!)
</p>


<pre class="src src-elisp"><span style="color: #99c5d3;">(</span><span style="color: #aac59a;">cl-loop</span>
<span style="color: #aac59a;"> for seq being the key-seqs of KEYMAP</span>
<span style="color: #aac59a;"> using (</span><span style="color: #99c5d3;">key-bindings cmd</span><span style="color: #aac59a;">)</span>
 <span style="color: #aac59a;">as key = (</span><span style="color: #99c5d3;">key-description</span><span style="color: #99c5d3;"> seq</span><span style="color: #aac59a;">)</span>
 <span style="color: #aac59a;">do ...</span><span style="color: #99c5d3;">)</span>
</pre>


<p>
In the above loop, you'll get access to KEY and its bound command, CMD.  And that brings me to the gotcha.
</p>

<p>
Here's what happened to me: if KEYMAP has many adjacent keys bound to the same command (which is typically only either <code>nil</code> or <code>self-insert-command</code>), then <code>(keymap-lookup KEYMAP key)</code> will error out saying that these keys are invalid: <code>SPC..~</code>, <code>ESC i..j</code>, <code>C-x (..*</code>, <code>\200..\377</code>&#x2026; Can you guess what's going on?
</p>

<p>
I can't, but these "keys" are definitely not keys, but ranges of keys.  I think it might only happen in global-map, actually.
</p>

<p>
Filter them out with a simple <code>(not (string-search ".." key))</code>.
</p>

<p>
And it turns out there's a couple more more sanitizations you'll probably want.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Command bindings that are actually <code>nil</code>.</li>
<li>Command bindings that are actually lists of the form <code>(menu-item ... ... ...)</code>.  At least, I <i>assume</i> you have no interest in such bindings.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thus, sanitized form:
</p>

<h2 id="orgabc41ef"><a href="#orgabc41ef">Bonus: get all bindings for the current buffer</a></h2>

<p>
OK great, we can unnest a single keymap variable (such as <code>org-mode-map</code> or <code>global-map</code>) and its children into a flat list of key seqs.  But what about listing all the current buffer's keys, not just one map's keys? 
</p>

<p>
You know that any given key can usually be found several times in multiple keymaps.  The current buffer has a sort of keymap composite calculated by merging all relevant keymaps.  And that composite is not stored anywhere in Emacs, not as a named variable.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately we can know which binding is correct for the current buffer thanks to the fact that <code>current-active-maps</code> seems to return maps in the order in which Emacs selects them.  So what comes earlier in the list is what would in fact be used.  Then we can run <code>delete-dups</code> to declutter the list, which likewise keeps the first instance of each set of duplicates.
</p>

<p>
Presto &#x2013; list current buffer keys:

Uncompiled, this is somewhat slow (0.5 seconds on a Surface Pro 7).  Compiled is much faster, but we can also speed it up somewhat with caching.  That trick really comes into its own when you want to filter the result with all sorts of inefficient checks; add your custom checks inside the defun <code>seq-to-key-if-legal</code> in the following snippet.

<title>Science as curiosity-stopper</title>

<p>
[&#x2026;] But now suppose instead that I don’t go on television. I do not wish to share the power, nor the truth behind it. I want to keep my sorcery secret. And yet I also want to cast my spells whenever and wherever I please. I want to cast my brilliant flare of light so that I can read a book on the train—without anyone becoming curious. Is there a spell that stops curiosity?
</p>

<p>
Yes indeed! Whenever anyone asks “How did you do that?” I just say “Science!”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ever since the author pointed this out (and to some extent, ever since I read <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">Lockhart's Lament</a> sometime prior to <a class="privy daily" href="../ggmxp/2012-12-22">2012-12-22</a>), I like to look at things people regard as ordinary, and wonder about them.  I still haven't understood light-bulbs, but they're a puzzle I'm working on, and the more I understand, the more I appreciate light-bulbs: <a class="pub stub" href="../vtvpn/joy-in-the-merely-real">Joy In the Merely Real</a>.
</p>

<p>
There was an internet meme making the rounds around 2015: "magnets, how do they work?"  Some people found it hilarious.  In my interpretation, it's rare to be aware you don't know that much about ordinary things, and that's why it tickled these people.  Humor is pointing out something unexpected.
</p>

<p>
I'm over here just saying "well, I haven't learned yet about magnets"&#x2026; and while that's interesting, laughing about it would be like laughing at a chair being brown.
</p>

<p>
It isn't a reaction I could ever have.  Engagement and fascination, yes, but laugh?  Laugh at what?
</p>

<p>
The fact someone else knows the answer to the mystery doesn't make it any less of a magical mystery for you.
</p>

<p>
When people are given "teacher's passwords" that explain some scientific fact, they may even undervalue its surprisingness due to hindsight bias.  The "I could have predicted that" effect: <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/WnheMGAka4fL99eae/hindsight-devalues-science">hindsight devalues science</a>.
</p>

<p>
If they knew how little of their knowledge they could regenerate, perhaps they will feel more shocked (<a class="pub" href="../whdhx/how-to-feel-shocked-enough">How to feel shocked enough?</a>) and wonder "How can it be?  This seems impossible!"

<p>
One of the chief morals of the mathematical analogy between thermodynamics and cognition is that the constraints of probability are inescapable; probability may be a subjective state of mind, but the <i>laws</i> of probability are harder than steel.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;] Here's a little experiment: Smash an egg on the floor.  The rule that says that the egg won't spontaneously reform and leap back into your hand is merely probabilistic.  A suggestion, if you will.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;] It may help to think of it this way&#x2014;if you still have some lingering intuition that uncertain beliefs are not authoritative:
</p>

<p>
In reality, there may be a very small chance that the egg spontaneously reforms.  But you cannot <i>expect</i> it to reform.  You must expect it to smash.  Your mandatory belief is that the egg's probability of spontaneous reformation is ~0.  Probabilities are not certainties, but the laws of probability are theorems.
</p>

<p>
If you doubt this, try dropping the egg on the floor a few decillion times.

<title>Conservation of Expected Evidence</title>

</p>

<p>
A special case: <a class="pub" href="../hlqrv/absence-of-evidence-is-evidence-of-absence">Absence of evidence is evidence of absence</a>.
</p>

<p>
For an ideal Bayesian, it is impossible to go on a quest to confirm a theory.  (Everything you know is already baked into your current confidence; if you can guess what you will end up believing, you are already there)  You can devise no plan by which you expect to find evidence that increases your confidence in some proposition, compared to where it is now.
</p>

<p>
You only seek evidence to test your current belief.  If you legitimately believe the evidence will come out in favor of theory A, and it does, it should only fractionally increase your belief in A, since it was not surprising, whereas if you found counterevidence, that must strongly decrease it.  Something that genuinely increases your Pr(A) must come from a research question where you are genuinely unsure if the outcome will support A.
</p>

<p>
The notion of "expectation of evidence" needs some unpacking.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld was a priest who heard the confessions of many witches, so he was in a position to observe every branch of the accusation tree that witches were exposed to.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the witch had led an evil and improper life, she was guilty; if she had led a good and proper life, this too was a proof, for witches dissemble and try to appear especially virtuous. After the woman was put in prison: if she was afraid, this proved her guilt; if she was not afraid, this proved her guilt, for witches characteristically pretend innocence and wear a bold front. Or on hearing of a denunciation of witchcraft against her, she might seek flight or remain; if she ran, that proved her guilt; if she remained, the devil had detained her so she could not get away.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He wrote a book in 1631: Cautio Criminalis ("prudence in criminal cases").  (the origin of jurisprudence?)
</p>

<p>
This fails the basic law <span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mtext> </mtext><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> Pr(H) = Pr(H,E) + Pr(H,~E). </annotation></semantics></math></span>

</p>

<p>
People may have been uneducated in the 1600s, but not stupid, so what went wrong?  It's just that in each court case, the jury only hears one branch of the dilemma.  They are not thinking at the policy level.  If both a piece of evidence and its absence can work as proof, then why even look for the "evidence"?  You'd easily realize this if you thought ahead of time about what the evidence would mean.
</p>

<p>
There's a lesson to learn here.  If someone serves you some evidence together with a compelling interpretation, think back on what you would've thought if the evidence had been different.  Remember all the women who confessed to F. Spee von Langenfeld to paint his complete picture; remember that "an expectation of evidence implies an opposite expectation of counterevidence".
